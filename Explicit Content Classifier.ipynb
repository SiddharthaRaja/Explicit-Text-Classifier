      "Original Article : 2023 Women's World Cup odds: Bettors cash in on New Zealand upsetting Norway\n",
      "It didn’t take long for an upset to register in the Women’s World Cup odds market. In fact, it took only two matches to get a surprise result, coming on the 32-team tournament’s first day.\n",
      "Adam Pullen, assistant director of trading for Caesars Sports, and BetMGM sports trader Seamus Magee, discuss how the Day 1 upset impacted World Cup betting.\n",
      "Underdog day\n",
      "Norway entered the Group A match as a -250 favorite (bet $10 to win $14 total) on BetMGM’s three-way moneyline, on which bettors can wager on either team to win in 90 minutes plus injury time or wager on the game ending in a draw. On the flip side, New Zealand was a sizable +650 underdog (bet $10 to win $75 total).\n",
      "\"It was quite a shock to start the tournament,\" Magee said. \"It feels like upsets of this magnitude in the tournament are few and far between.\"\n",
      "The first half brought no scoring, but it didn’t take long into the second half for the host Football Ferns — Team Norway’s nickname — to tally the match’s only goal. Hannah Wilkinson took a perfectly placed Jacqui Hand cross and buried the ball into the back of the net in the 48th minute.\n",
      "New Zealand’s 1-0 lead held up the rest of the way, with Norway’s best chance — a Tuva Hansen shot in the 83rd minute — deflecting off the crossbar.\n",
      "No place like home\n",
      "Home-country fans reveled in the upset, as did any savvy bettors who took New Zealand. Caesars Sports apparently had quite a few customers banking on the big underdog.\n",
      "When Caesars first posted moneyline odds, New Zealand was +950 to win the match, meaning a $100 bet would win $950. By the time the match began, Caesars customers had helped shorten New Zealand’s price to +650, with Norway a -250 favorite and draw +333.\n",
      "\"As is normal in a major soccer competition, the underdog winning the match is not a great outcome for sportsbooks,\" Pullen said. \"People are enamored with the huge price on the underdog and love that return on investment. It was a small loss [for us] with the Ferns’ win over Norway. Nothing major, but a good win for the bettors indeed.\"\n",
      "WynnBet trader Dominick DeBonis echoed Pullen's comments.\n",
      "\"We got whacked pretty good on the result, relative to the handle. That's to be expected on big ‘dogs who are playing a team that isn’t the U.S. Women's National Team,\" DeBonis said.\n",
      "BetMGM beats the bettors\n",
      "Likewise, BetMGM’s odds prior to kickoff had New Zealand a +650 underdog. But the result worked out much better behind the counter for BetMGM, with the large majority of tickets and dollars on favored Norway.\n",
      "\"New Zealand was a big winner for us in this match,\" Magee said. \"Lots of money came in on Norway. New Zealand [winning] broke up a ton of parlays.\"\n",
      "Indeed, throwing Norway into a parlay likely seemed reasonable for most bettors. In the 2019 World Cup, Norway reached the quarterfinals before losing to England. Prior to Thursday’s opening match, BetMGM had Norway as the +5000 12th choice in odds to win the World Cup, while New Zealand was a distant +200000 (200-1) to win the tournament.\n",
      "Now, Norway will have to scramble just to advance from Group A, while New Zealand, for the moment, is favored to win the group. New Zealand is playing in its sixth Women’s World Cup, but Thursday’s upset marked the team’s first-ever World Cup victory.\n",
      "\"This is definitely a pleasant surprise for the book on this one,\" Magee said.\n",

      "Sample 3\n",
      "Original Article : In February 2010, Peter Turchin, a relatively obscure researcher at the University of Connecticut, wrote a letter to the distinguished journal Nature. He was responding to their “2020 visions” issue – an upbeat dawn-of-the-decade exercise that collected predictions of progress from across science and politics. Turchin assumed the role of Cassandra. “The next decade is likely to be a period of growing instability in the United States and western Europe,” he wrote, “which could undermine the sort of scientific progress you describe.” He pointed to waves of disruption that tend to recur every 50 years. “All these cycles look set to peak in the years around 2020.” There was still time to change course, though: with measures to improve wellbeing and reduce economic inequality, “records show that societies can avert disaster”.\n",
      "Normally scientists enjoy being proved right, but for Turchin, the way the following decade panned out must have seemed a bit too on-the-nose. The response to the financial crisis wasn’t a New Deal-style rescue package as he’d recommended, but austerity and a widening of the gap between rich and poor. Frustration at the established order threw up Brexit in Britain and Trump in the US. Right on cue, 2020 delivered a pandemic, economic chaos and a president who refused to concede defeat at the polls. The following January saw the storming of the Capitol, and images of insurrection that seemed like a throwback to an earlier revolutionary era.\n",
      "Now Turchin is having another go at explaining those cycles of disruption and what it might take to emerge unscathed (though he tells me that, unlike in 2010, it’s past time to avoid the consequences entirely: “We are in crisis – but it’s not too late to take a less bloody exit.”) His book’s title, End Times, doesn’t exactly inspire confidence, but it does provide a clear theory about how we got into this mess, and how to get out of it. There are some familiar concepts here – falling living standards leading to mass discontent – but others, “elite overproduction” in particular, are much less widely recognised, and genuinely eye-opening.\n",
      "For a global prophet of doom, Turchin cuts a surprisingly ordinary figure. He speaks to me over Zoom from the sofa in his modest living room in Storrs, Connecticut, essentially a village with a huge university campus attached. “We have a house in the woods,” he tells me, and praises the area’s “low population density” in a way that makes me wonder if he’s prepping for the apocalypse. The reality is less alarming. “You know, my wife has a garden, it’s very comfortable.” A bit like a dacha, he observes – a reminder, alongside his strong accent, that he was born in the USSR – “a country that doesn’t exist any more”. He emigrated with his dissident parents in 1977, when he was 20.\n",
      "That background makes him less sanguine than others might be about the prospect of societal upheaval – even state collapse. “I went back for the first time since leaving in 1992, and I experienced a failed state. Now, when I’d moved to the United States in 1977, the [country] was really at the brink of several trends beginning to point downwards,” he says, tracing the path of a rollercoaster with his right hand. “I saw the end of the Golden Age – from the common people’s point of view – and it has been downhill since then. So I’m really worried about ending up in another failed state.”\n",
      "I point out that this will seem like hyperbole to lots of people. “I don’t say that it’s 100% certain,” he counters – and notably refuses to be drawn on whether Trump will be re-elected in 2024. “The road out of crisis opens up a whole set of possibilities, from pretty mild instability all the way to collapse. At this point, pretty much anything is possible.”\n",
      "What were those downward-pointing trends in the 1970s, then? That decade, Turchin argues, was when the social contract established in the 1930s – Roosevelt’s New Deal – began to disintegrate. For 40 years, America had effectively replicated the Nordic model under which the interests of workers, owners and the state were kept in balance (he’s careful to point out that a significant portion of the population – mostly Black Americans – were always shut out of this cosy arrangement). After that, things began to shift in favour of owners. The power of unions was eroded, as were labour rights. Typical wages started to lag behind economic growth, or even decrease. Quality of life suffered, and with it life expectancy. “Diseases of despair” such as opioid or alcohol abuse grew. Turchin even links the rise of mass shootings to a generalised hopelessness he refers to as “popular immiseration”.\n",
      "At the same time, the rich got richer – far richer. A system of taxation that weighed most heavily on the highest earners, including a top rate of 90%, was dismantled. The number of decamillionaires, or households worth over $10m, increased from 66,000 in 1983 to 693,000 in 2019, accounting for inflation. The economy chugged along nicely, but the share of it controlled by the wealthiest got larger at the expense of the average earner. Turchin calls this the “wealth pump”. Things are now set up, he argues, so that money gushes away from workers and towards the elite, like a blowout from an oil well.\n",
      "This has an interesting effect: so-called “elite overproduction”, a phrase coined by Turchin’s colleague, the sociologist Jack Goldstone. “The social pyramid has grown top heavy,” he explains, with rich families and top universities churning out more wealthy graduates than the system can accommodate. To illustrate this, Turchin describes a game of musical chairs with a twist. There’s always been a limited number of powerful positions, be they senator, governor, supreme court justice or media mogul. In an era of elite overproduction, rather than chairs being taken away whenever the music stops, the number of competitors increases instead. Before you know it, there are far more people than can realistically attain high office. Fights break out. Norms (and chairs) are overturned as “elite aspirants” – those who have been brought up in the expectation of a say in how things are run – turn into counter-elites, prepared to smash the system to get their way. This isn’t just a US problem, by the way; Turchin says that Britain is on a similar trajectory. In fact, among OECD countries, it’s next in line. Germany is further behind, but also on the same “slippery slope”.\n",
      "Turchin, who was a mathematical ecologist before turning to history in the mid-2000s, brings a numbers approach to his adopted subject. He was able to predict the turbulent 2020s by looking at economic and social indicators from 100 historical crises, gathered together in a database called CrisisDB. They range from medieval France to 19th-century Britain, and show that periods of instability are pretty consistently preceded by a decline in wages, the emergence of a wealth pump, and most combustibly, elite overproduction.\n",
      "Why is the latter so important? Well, the masses may be miserable, but without someone who has the status and resources to organise them, they’ll simply languish. Their revolutionary potential is only realised once a “political entrepreneur” – usually a frustrated elite aspirant – gets involved. Robespierre, Lenin and Castro are all examples of highly privileged individuals who felt excluded from existing power structures and led popular movements to overthrow them. In 19th-century China, a young man from a well-to-do family failed the exams that would have enabled him to become a top flight imperial administrator four times. Hong Xiuquan went on to lead a rebellion in which at least 20 million died.\n",
      "Things may not be quite as bad as that yet, but it’s not hard to identify modern-day figures who fit the elite aspirant mould. Donald Trump is the most obvious, a beneficiary of the wealth pump whose only route to power was as a political entrepreneur stoking grievance. Nigel Farage? “He’s a good example. He’s personally wealthy, a member of the economic elite. And he has been channelling discontent.” Sometimes counter-elites mount their takeover from the inside. With Brexit, “there was a traditional segment of the Conservative party, but then there was an insurgent part. And they were [also] using this discontent. What we see in history is that one segment of the elite channels popular discontent to advance their political careers. This happened in Republican Rome 2,000 years ago, and it happens now.”\n",
      "Another distinctive feature of elite overproduction is the fierce ideological competition it generates. Turchin believes we’ve transitioned from the pre-crisis period, where political entrepreneurs largely attacked the established order, to a phase in which newly powerful factions are fighting among themselves. This, he argues, is one of the mechanisms behind “cancel culture”. “Such vicious ideological struggles are a common phase in any revolution,” he writes. There is a race to the extremes, with denunciations becoming more and more intense. “In the struggle between rival factions, the ones willing to escalate accusations win over the moderate ones.”\n",
      "So how do we fix things? It strikes me that there are some pretty obvious political conclusions to be drawn from Turchin’s research, but he’s reluctant to be led too far down the road of punditry. “I don’t want to enter into the political infighting,” he says. “One thing that we know about historical exits from crisis is that at some point the elites and population have to pull together … the different factions have to be reconciled. That’s why I try to stay away from taking sides.”\n",
      "He will, however, admit to “several recommendations”, saying that “some of them will please liberals, others will please conservatives”. Liberals, presumably, will be heartened by the idea that “we need to give workers more power”. In order to turn off the wealth pump you have to increase labour’s share of the pie at the expense of business. Partly by redistribution, but partly by beefing up workers’ ability to demand higher pay.\n",
      "What kind of thing would please conservatives? Here he seems to hesitate slightly. “Let’s say … massive immigration does depress the wages of common workers. Actually, this is a paleo-left position. It’s just now the new left is focusing more on cultural issues, and they are all for immigration, but conservatives are now against immigration.” He elaborates, saying it’s an “iron law” of economics that if you increase the supply of something – in this case, labour – then its price will decline. “But,” he points out, “it won’t happen if workers have enough social power, if there are good labour organisations and, also, if the elites internalise the need for dividing fairly the fruits of economic growth. So if you have those institutions, then immigration is not a problem.”\n",
      "And what about those surplus elites? Well, if you happen to be one, look away now. Halfway through End Times Turchin remarks, somewhat blithely: “In order for stability to return, elite overproduction somehow needs to be taken care of – historically and typically by eliminating the surplus elites through massacre, imprisonment, emigration, or forced or voluntary downward social mobility.” In fact, CrisisDB allows us to be even more precise: in 40% of crises, rulers were assassinated; 75% ended in revolutions or civil wars (or both), and in 20%, those civil wars dragged on for a century or longer. Sixty percent of the time the state in question disappeared, either through conquest or disintegration.\n",
      "It would be nice to avoid a century-long civil war. Perhaps instead we can select “voluntary downward social mobility” from Turchin’s grisly menu. This would require elites to be persuaded to give up some of their wealth, or to decide to do so off their own backs. Patriotic Millionaires, a pressure group made up of rich people, including members of the Disney family, who “share a profound concern about the destabilising level of economic and political inequality in America” is probably unrepresentative of the class as a whole. More likely, things will have to get so bad that a new social contract becomes the only alternative to levels of discontent that would threaten private fortunes in any case. That’s what happened in the 1930s. It also happened in Britain in the 1830s, when the prospect of a revolution like the ones sweeping Europe was kept at bay by the Great Reform Act and the repeal of the corn laws (it also helped that frustrated elite aspirants could try their hand at running distant parts of the empire).\n",
      "In any case, it seems we’ll know what the denouement is before too long. “The nice thing about CrisisDB is that we now have statistics on how long these periods last,” Turchin tells me. “Roughly speaking, it’s 10 to 20 years. Very few shorter, some much longer. But for those who think that we’re [already] out of it in the United States? That’s not very likely.” I nod, and make a mental note to speak to him again in 2033.\n",

      "Original Article : Missouri Supreme Court orders attorney general to let abortion ballot initiative go forward\n",
      "Missouri’s ballot initiative to legalize abortion will be allowed to move forward after the state Supreme Court ruled the attorney general was improperly stonewalling the effort.\n",
      "The court ruled unanimously on Thursday that Attorney General Andrew Bailey (R) was using “misleading” and “incorrect” arguments to justify delaying his approval of the cost estimates ballot measure that would allow residents to vote on whether to legalize abortion, a crucial step in the certification process.\n",
      "The delay stretched far beyond the normal time the state allows for reviewing and approving ballot initiatives, meaning supporters were unable to start collecting signatures to try to place the measure on the ballot for next year’s election.\n",
      "The court acknowledged the harm to plaintiff Anna Fitz-James and the initiative process. The process should take approximately 54 days, according to the ACLU of Missouri, which represented Fitz-James. Instead, it’s taken at least 135 days.\n",
      "“Until the official ballot title is certified – a critical step being held up solely by the Attorney General’s unjustified refusal to act – Fitz-James cannot challenge that title in circuit court or circulate her petitions,” the judges wrote. “Fitz-James’s constitutional right of initiative petition is being obstructed, and the deadline for submitting signed petitions draws nearer every day.”\n",
      "In a statement, the ACLU of Missouri applauded the decision.\n",
      "“While today is a tremendous victory for Missourians and the right to direct democracy, it is clear that some who hold office will not hesitate to trample the constitution if it advances their personal interests and political beliefs,” said Luz María Henríquez, the group’s executive director.\n",
      "The dispute dates back to March, when as part of the procedure to qualify a ballot initiative, the state Auditor’s office conducted a cost estimate. State auditor Scott Fitzpatrick found the proposal would have no known impact on state funds and an estimated cost of at least $51,000 annually in reduced local tax revenues, although “opponents estimate a potentially significant loss to state revenue.”\n",
      "Bailey rejected those estimates and refused to approve them. Bailey instead said his office estimated the measure’s impact would be “drastic,” and could cost taxpayers upwards of $12 billion because of a loss of Medicaid funding.\n",
      "Missouri was the first state to enact a “trigger law” in the wake of the Supreme Court’s decision overturning Roe v. Wade, and has one of the strictest abortion bans in the country. There are some exceptions for medical emergencies, but not for rape or incest.\n",
      "The proposed ballot initiative would enshrine the right to make decisions about abortion, birth control, childbirth and other issues related to pregnancy in the state’s Constitution.\n",
      "Ballot measures to protect abortion have been successful in other conservative states. As a result, state officials have been working to try to make the measure process much more difficult, if not ban it completely.\n",
      "The court ruled the attorney general has the authority only to review the “legal content and form” of the auditor’s reports, “not their substance.”\n",
      "Nothing in state law “gives the attorney general authority to question the auditor’s assessment of the fiscal impact of a proposed petition,” the court ruled\n",
      "The attorney general must now approve the auditor’s fiscal assessment by 1 p.m. July 21, and the amendment will then be able to move forward.\n",
      "The proposal will next go to the office of the Missouri secretary of state, who is tasked with certifying the fiscal assessment and a summary of the proposal that would appear on the ballot. Once that occurs, supporters can start gathering the more than 100,000 signatures needed.\n",

      "Original Article : The Defense Department has no plans to stop covering the travel costs of female troops who seek abortions across state lines, despite protests from a Republican senator who has blocked hundreds of military promotions over the issue, Army Secretary Christine Wormuth said on Thursday.\n",
      "“I see this, and I think the (defense secretary) does as well, as taking care of our soldiers, and it’s the right thing to do, and I don’t think we’re going to change it,” Wormuth told NBC News’ Courtney Kube at an event at the Aspen Security Forum.\n",
      "Since the Supreme Court’s Dobbs v. Jackson decision removed the constitutional right to abortion last year, more than 40% of female service members stationed in the United States have no access, or severely restricted access, to abortion services, according to the Rand Corporation think tank.\n",
      "Wormuth said the policy also was important to ensure that the Army can retain female troops who might leave the military if they cannot get access to abortion services. “I see this as a retention issue,” Wormuth said.\n",
      "The policy also ensures women in the military have access to in vitro fertilization, since it is not necessarily available in the areas where troops are posted, Wormuth said.\n",
      "Wormuth said she had not seen data on how many female troops had traveled across state lines for abortion services or the amount of Defense Department funds spent on it so far.\n",
      "Republican Sen. Tommy Tuberville of Alabama has held up the promotions of more than 250 military officers for months in order to force an end to the policy.\n",
      "Tuberville says he wants a vote on a bill introduced by Sen. Jeanne Shaheen, D-N.H., that would codify the Pentagon abortion policy into law, and that he will end his blockade if it passes. In return, Tuberville says that he wants the Defense Department to agree to cancel the policy if the measure fails.\n",
      "Defense Department officials held a closed-door briefing Wednesday with senators on the Armed Services Committee, including Tuberville, regarding the department’s abortion travel policy, NBC News has previously reported.\n",
      "The issue has complicated the normally bipartisan politics that surround the National Defense Authorization Act, an annual defense policy bill. Republicans in the House have inserted an amendment into their version of the bill that would force the Pentagon to end the policy.\n",
      "Wormuth, echoing comments by other Pentagon officials and senior officers, said the blockade is having ripple effects on troops and families that could jeopardize readiness and prompt some service members to quit.\n",
      "“Basically what’s happening is our whole system is getting kind of constipated,” Wormuth said.\n",
      "About a dozen three- and four-star generals have had to put off their retirements for two or three months, and the officers selected to replace them are not in their new positions, she said.\n",
      "The biggest concern, she said, is that junior officers may conclude that it’s not worth remaining in the military given the uncertainty and delays affecting their families.\n",
      "“I really worry that we’re going to have a brain and talent drain as a result of this really unprecedented step that Sen. Tuberville has chosen,” she said.\n",
      "The blockade on promotions is just the latest example of the military being drawn into Washington’s polarized politics and turned into a “political football,” Wormuth said.\n",

      "Original Article : TikTok has finally launched an ads transparency library — starting with data on ads and other commercial content running in Europe but with plans to expand that.\n",
      "Also today it’s announced expanded access to its research API to Europe.\n",
      "Both moves look intended to help the company comply with incoming requirements under the European Union’s Digital Services Act (DSA). Back in April, the video-sharing social network was confirmed as one of 19 so-called very large online platforms (VLOPs) under the DSA — a designation which brings a suite of additional compliance requirements related to algorithmic transparency and accountability.\n",
      "To wit: Article 39 of the pan-EU regulation requires VLOPs whose platforms display ads to offers a searchable database of ads with information, including who paid for the ad, the main targeting parameters and data on views. While Article 40 concerns data access for vetted and other external researchers to further the regulation’s goal of ensuring that systemic risks flowing from major platforms are able to be robustly studied.\n",
      "“Today, we’re expanding access to our Research API to Europe and opening up new transparency tools for commercial content,” TikTok wrote in a blog post announcing the launches. “These tools are designed to enhance transparency about content on our platform and are informed by feedback we’re hearing from researchers and civil society.”\n",
      "A TikTok spokesman confirmed the research API is being made available to researchers working across Europe, not only those at institutions inside the EU — so it’s also open to applications from academics working in the EEA (European Economic Area), Switzerland and the UK.\n",
      "The social media platform announced it was developing an API for researchers last summer — when it said it would provide select researchers with more transparency about its platform and moderation system by giving access to public and anonymized data about content and activity on the app. An initial version of the Research API was ready for testing by members of TikTok’s Content and Safety Advisory Councils in November — before being opened up to academic researchers in the US earlier this year, in February.\n",
      "So far, the free API has seen more than 60 applications from US non-profit academic researchers on topics including those related to consumer trends, misinformation and mental health, per TikTok.\n",
      "The impact of social media platforms on young people’s lives and well-being continues to be a topic of discussion and concern in mainstream media. But scientists have warned we still don’t have robust data to draw strong conclusions — hence the push by EU lawmakers to make major platforms open up to outside scrutiny.\n",
      "TikTok’s approach for the research API requires researchers to create an account and complete an application which it reviews to ensure its criteria are met before granting access. So it said it expects the first non-profit academic researchers in Europe to get access “in the coming weeks”.\n",
      "TikTok’s criteria for access to the API require regional researchers to have demonstrable academic experience and expertise in the research area specified in the application; no conflicts of interest with respect to using the services; a clearly defined research proposal; and to be committed to only using the data for non-commercial purposes.\n",
      "Also today, it said it’s working on being able to grant researchers who are collaborating with others the ability to work together on a shared research project. This incoming collaboration feature, which it says it’s adding in response to feedback from early users, will be called “Lab Access”.\n",
      "“More than half the applications we’ve received request collaboration with other researchers, so we’ll soon be allowing up to 10 researchers to work together on a shared research project,” it wrote. “All researchers will need to have their own TikTok for Developers account and be located in the US or Europe to access our Research API.\n",
      "“Principal researchers will be able to submit a single application for collaborators from the same university. Projects involving multiple universities will need to submit separate applications for each school.”\n",
      "Ads transparency at last\n",
      "The ads transparency library, or “Commercial Content Library” as TikTok is billing it, is a newer initiative — and the launch plugs a long-standing transparency gap for the platform.\n",
      "A critical report on TikTok by Mozilla, back in mid 2021, found policy loopholes, lax oversight around influencer marketing and the lack of a public, searchable ads database was making the platform vulnerable to passing off political ads as organic content — rendering TikTok’s official policy banning political ads pretty meaningless.\n",
      "Now anyone can search TikTok ads or other commercial content by country, date and keyword.\n",
      "However — big caveat! — for now only data on commercial stuff running in Europe is available. TikTok said it plans to include data from “more countries” in the future (but did not specify where or when).\n",
      "“The Commercial Content Library is a searchable database with information about paid ads and ad metadata, such as the advertising creative, dates the ad ran, main parameters used for targeting (e.g. age, gender), number of people who were served the ad, and more,” TikTok noted.\n",
      "The tool also includes information about other content that’s “commercial in nature and tagged with either a paid partnership label or promotional label, such as content that promotes a brand, product or service but is not a paid ad” — so TikTok is including influence marketing in the database too (or at least it is if the influencers have correctly tagged their videos).\n",
      "“We tested an early version of the Commercial Content Library with researchers and civil society to gather feedback over the last few months before making it more broadly available,” TikTok added. “From our tests and input from experts, we’ve added the ability to perform precise searches, included more targeting parameters, and improved data quality — among other updates.”\n",
      "TikTok is also providing access to a Commercial Content API to enable researchers to query the ads database.\n",
      "“Researchers will need to create a TikTok Developers account and submit an application to access the Commercial Content API which we review to help prevent malicious actors from misusing this data,” it added.\n",

      "The release stated Laughton has been charged alongside former \"intimate partner\" Lindsay Groves, a daycare worker in Tyngsborough, Massachusetts, who a preliminary forensic review showed had more than 10,000 text messages between the two \"that included discussion about, and transfer of, explicit photographs that Groves had taken of children while employed at Creative Minds daycare.\"\n",

      "They are clean, quiet, fun to drive and help us tackle the biggest challenge of our era, climate change.\n",
      "But there are some big bumps along the road to the UK's electric destiny.\n",
      "Electric vehicles (EVs) are expensive, there aren't enough chargers, and the switchover could destroy one of the UK's biggest industries.\n",
      "There is pressure on both the Conservatives and Labour to review their climate commitments following the Tories' surprise win in the Uxbridge by-election - where the upcoming extension of London's Ultra Low Emission Zone was one of the big issues.\n",
      "But the government is currently sticking to its plan - supported by Labour - to ban sales of new petrol and diesel cars from 2030. Sales of hybrid cars will be stopped from 2035.\n",
      "So, can we meet the target?\n",
      "Electric cars are selling fast, but are not without controversy. Justin Rowlatt, the BBC's climate editor, explores if the UK is on track to hit the government's targets to stop emitting greenhouse gases by 2050.\n",
      "Watch on BBC One at 20:00 BST on Tuesday 25 July, and afterwards on BBC iPlayer\n",
      "Let's start with the price, because EVs are still very expensive.\n",
      "The cheapest EV on sale in the UK with a decent range will set you back north of Â£30,000.\n",
      "That's significantly more than an equivalent petrol or diesel car.\n",
      "However, there are much cheaper electric cars in the pipeline.\n",
      "The talk of the Shanghai Motor Show in April wasn't some new sports car but a super-cheap new EV called the Seagull.\n",
      "Manufactured by BYD, the Chinese battery and car behemoth, the basic Seagull has a 190-mile range and a list price in China of 78,000 yen (Â£8,400).\n",
      "It will be a while before you can buy one, though. The company currently has no plans to sell the Seagull in the UK.\n",
      "The world is racing to get a piece of the electric car market and the minerals - lithium, nickel, cobalt - packed into EV batteries are currently in short supply.\n",
      "That makes them expensive, and it is likely to be some time before new mineral supplies become more widely available.\n",
      "Meanwhile, the UK government has stopped offering grants to help EV buyers.\n",
      "Apart from the cost, the other main reasons people give for not going electric are fears about range and charging.\n",
      "And, with a growing market like EVs, perceptions are as important as reality.\n",
      "If people believe electric cars are unreliable that is a huge problem.\n",
      "When Times columnist Giles Coren wrote about how his expensive electric car died during a family holiday it became his most commented-on article.\n",
      "He described how his wife and children had to \"strike out on foot across the fields in the driving rain and gathering darkness\" while the car was \"a lifeless corpse blocking the single-track road\".\n",
      "Surveys suggest that most owners are actually broadly satisfied with their electric cars.\n",
      "Range is becoming less of a problem as many new EVs can go 200 miles on a single charge and often much more, but how and where to charge the batteries remains a big issue.\n",
      "You might have seen warnings that there are more than 30 electric car owners \"fighting over\" every public charge point.\n",
      "However, almost two thirds of electric car owners have off-street parking and will rarely ever use public chargers.\n",
      "With 200 miles-plus \"in the tank\" every morning, most people find they don't often need to top up.\n",
      "But according to the RAC Foundation, 35% of people in Great Britain don't have off-street parking (a figure rising to 55% in London), and virtually all car owners will want to make longer journeys sometimes.\n",
      "So, installing more public chargers - particularly rapid chargers, which can charge a car from 0% to 80% in about 30 minutes - is crucial.\n",
      "One reason the ratio of chargers to EVs is low is that electric cars have been selling so well. They made up 16.6% of new car registrations in 2022 - up from 0.4% in 2016.\n",
      "But it is also taking time to roll out charging infrastructure.\n",
      "As of June this year, there were 44,408 charging points across the UK, 8,680 of which were rapid chargers.\n",
      "The government has set a target of 300,000 public charging stations (of all speeds) by 2030, although the Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders (SMMT) has called for 2.3 million to meet demand from motorists.\n",
      "The number of chargers being installed in the UK is rising each month - in June, 1,677 were installed in public places.\n",
      "But unless the government ups its game, it's still likely to be more than 100,000 short of its 2030 target.\n",
      "It says it can catch up, but admits that annual installations will have to more than double by 2025.\n",
      "In 2022, the government also said it wanted at least six rapid chargers in every motorway service area in England by the end of this year.\n",
      "However, in May the RAC said that this was unlikely to be achieved at the current rate of progress.\n",
      "In the meantime, the British car industry is grappling with an even bigger problem - by 2030 it isn't going to have a market in the UK any more unless it goes electric.\n",
      "That should concern us all because car manufacturing is an important industry in the UK.\n",
      "About 780,000 people are employed in jobs connected with it - and it contributes an estimated Â£14bn a year to the economy.\n",
      "The US, China and the EU are all investing billions of pounds to encourage electric vehicle manufacturing.\n",

      "\"It does make companies think twice about when they come to make their investment decisions,\" she warns.\n",
      "The big issue is battery production, the single most valuable part of an electric vehicle.\n",

      "The Conservative Party was barely mentioned in election leaflets, while Boris Johnson’s name didn’t come up once\n",
      "“Wow!” cried Steve Tuckwell, the new Tory MP for Uxbridge & South Ruislip, as he started his victory speech.\n",
      "Tuckwell’s razor-thin victory came as a surprise to pundits – but also to his own party and, apparently, to Tuckwell himself.\n",
      "Even though this true-blue slice of suburbia has voted Tory at every election for the last 53 years, most commentators had predicted that Labour would gain Boris Johnson’s old seat, which the former prime minister quit in sensational fashion last month.\n",
      "Instead, the Conservatives held on by 495 votes, slashing the previous majority of 7,210.\n",
      "The Covid-19 public inquiry is a historic chance to find out what really happened.\n",
      "Not that all of Uxbridge’s voters necessarily knew that Steve Tuckwell was a Conservative. openDemocracy collected a range of Conservative leaflets handed out during the campaign, barely any of which so much as mentioned the Conservative Party and even those only in small print. None of them mentioned Boris Johnson.\n",
      "The only mention of Rishi Sunak came in an eight-page booklet: there was a small photo of one of Sunak’s campaign stops, which didn’t even have a caption mentioning who he was. When Tuckwell gave his victory speech and interviews, he again failed to mention the prime minister.\n",
      "Instead, Tuckwell fought an almost single-issue campaign, opposing London mayor Sadiq Khan’s proposal to extend the Ultra-Low Emission Zone (ULEZ) to the outer suburbs.\n",
      "Voters could have been forgiven for thinking Tuckwell was standing as an independent. He was described as a “local man and anti-ULEZ campaigner”, and “The STOP ULEZ candidate”, with one voter quoted as saying “I’m voting for Steve to stop ULEZ”. Indeed, more than one voter openDemocracy spoke to said they were only bothering to turn out in order to register a protest against the scheme.\n",
      "This was despite the fact that the ULEZ policy was first introduced by Khan’s predecessor as mayor – the same Boris Johnson whose departure triggered the by-election.\n",
      "In this heavily car-dependent area, with wide roads and large drives, the issue clearly cut through. So did dislike of Sadiq Khan – whose photo appeared on Tuckwell’s leaflets almost as many times as Tuckwell himself.\n",
      "‘Horrendous on the doorsteps’\n",
      "Tuckwell, by his own admission to the BBC, “wasn’t expected to win this election”. He did not appear to have been briefed by CCHQ on the usual “lines to take”, either, instead simply repeating his ULEZ campaign theme in answer to almost every question.\n",
      "openDemocracy visited several local Conservative headquarters during the campaign. None seemed terribly energised; at the Uxbridge Conservative Club, our reporter was met with the words: “What are you doing here? You can’t come in – there’s no-one around to answer your questions.”\n",
      "Other Tory activists we spoke to said it had been “horrendous on the doorsteps” and that they weren’t expecting to hold the seat. Campaigners who were sent a morale-boosting video of the candidate on Wednesday night told openDemocracy that Tuckwell looked “exhausted”, and “a broken man”.\n",
      "At another Conservative HQ in the seat, a party worker told us that Boris Johnson had been “a divisive figure… he doesn’t come up on the doorstep much but, when he does, it’s negative”.\n",
      "None of the other parties managed to set the campaign ablaze with other issues. Both Labour and the Tories pledged to save a local police station, each blaming the other for its threatened closure.\n",
      "Meanwhile, Laurence Fox’s Reclaim Party was keen to claim momentum. It blitzed the constituency with glossy leaflets, held a string of press stunts, and on election day they tweeted a picture of Fox in an oak-panelled office with the words: “If things go well in Uxbridge and South Ruislip this evening, I give you the next PM of the United Kingdom.” Hours later, Fox lost his deposit, polling just 2.3%.\n",
      "Turnout\n",
      "This was a low-turnout election – though, at 46%, slightly less so than in either of yesterday’s other by-elections.\n",
      "As political reporters, we’re used to people being jaded. But speaking to voters a week before polling day, the anger seemed particularly bitter. This wasn’t the vague shrug of boredom with politics. It was an active rage.\n",
      "Most of the people we stopped in the street stormed off as soon as we mentioned the election.\n",
      "Many of those who did chat sneered at the idea of voting. Some had little idea a by-election was happening; some didn’t know Boris Johnson had been their MP. But they were proud not to be stupid enough to waste their time with all that.\n",
      "Some told us that they were voting, but only negatively – Tory because they were against ULEZ, Sadiq Khan or Labour in general; or Labour because they were against the Tories. No one we spoke to mentioned anything they were for, anything they were excited about, anything positive at all. If there was a mention of Starmer or Sunak, it was angry.\n",
      "“The only thing worse than no hope is false hope,” Labour front-bencher Wes Steeeting wrote recently. His party’s commitment to the second worst thing had clearly filtered through to people in Uxbridge.\n",
      "“We’re fucked,” said one man. If there was an attitude among the people openDemocracy spoke to on the high street in Uxbridge, he had summed it up.\n",
      "While the media tends to focus on swings in by-elections, in reality, they almost always have much lower turnouts than general elections. The stories they tell are about which parties do and don’t succeed in persuading their backers to the ballot box.\n",
      "The turnout means taking some of the headline results with a pinch of salt. In Selby and Ainsty, where Labour overturned a majority of 20,000 on a huge swing, their actual number of votes was only 2,600 higher than last time – but they benefited from a vast collapse in turnout among 2019 Tory supporters, just over one in three of whom turned out. In Somerton and Frome, where a 19,000 majority was turned into an 11,000 majority on a 29% swing, the Lib Dem vote was still 15,000 short of what the Tories polled last time. And in Uxbridge and South Ruislip, Labour lost 5,000 of its 2019 voters – if it had held its ground, it would have won comfortably. Meanwhile, the Tories managed to turn out more than half of their 2019 voters.\n",
      "Conservatives will take solace in the fact they managed to hang on in one of these three difficult seats. But the lesson they may draw from Uxbridge – disowning their own party label, and standing a hyper-local, single-issue candidate – may be one that they struggle to translate into a general election strategy.\n",

      "TeV stands for tera electron Volts or 1,000,000,000,000 electron Volts. 1 TeV is about the energy of motion of a flying mosquito.\n",

      "\"Indians have played quite a big role at CERN from the 1960s and 70s. There were stalwarts like (particle physicist) Prof Prince Malhotra who were already working at CERN, in collaboration with Delhi University, Punjab University, and so on. But everybody has been contributing for several decades.\"\n",
      "“Our contribution became much bigger, and we became an observer state in 1999. Then we became an associate member in 2017. So, opportunities started opening for Indian nationals,” she noted.\n",
      "Sharma is now working on making experiments at CERN more environment friendly.\n",
      "“I think we all have a duty towards the planet. So we need to look at ways and means on how we can work sustainably, especially given the very long nature of our experiments,” she added.\n",
      "CERN, the scientist said, is phasing out greenhouse gases such as freons as a coolant.\n",
      "“In the next generation, that is the upgrade, we have freon-less cooling. All the cooling that was leaking or giving (carbon) footprint in the atmosphere is going to be zero starting from 2027,” she said.\n",
      "CERN is also working on reducing carbon footprint by optimising energy usage in experiments.\n",
      "“We are reusing the waste energy that is being created from the accelerators into heating, because we need to heat buildings, and there are programmes on R&D. So we are definitely very conscious and we have a team that is looking into ways of improving sustainability,” Sharma said.\n",

So I try to do what I can to inspire the students.” “And I think scientific temperament in India is much better than in many other countries. Education and particularly scientific education is highly regarded in our country,” she added.\n",

      "Original Article : When the infamous slogan “education, education, education” was uttered by Sir Tony Blair in 1996 at the launch of Labour’s priorities for government in Blackpool, few could have foreseen the problems facing our bloated higher education sector today.\n",
      "In a report published last year by the Tony Blair Institute for Global Change, the former prime minister’s think tank acknowledged that a significant portion of Britain’s post-2008 economic growth had been on the back of the expansion of universities and colleges.\n",
      "The UK has “come to rely on the expansion of education to prop up economic growth”, the foreword said. It went on to recommend that the sector be expanded further, from approximately 53pc of young people going to university today to 60pc by 2030 and 70pc by 2040.\n",
      "Just a year after Sir Tony’s target of putting half of all young adults through higher education was finally reached in 2019, then education secretary Gavin Williamson announced that the “absurd mantra” would be dropped.\n",
      "It didn’t seem to matter that nearly a decade of Conservative education policies had been responsible for pushing that target over the line. In 2015 the government abolished the cap on the number of students each university was allowed to enrol.\n",
      "When tuition fees were raised in 2010 from £3,225 a year to £9,000 and again to £9,250 in 2017 it came with the proviso that universities would be expected to use the extra funding to expand access to higher education.\n",
      "But England’s higher education funding model is unlikely to remain sustainable for much longer. Tuition fees, which are currently frozen, will leave universities and colleges £2,500 out of pocket for every home student this year, with the shortfall expected to rise to £5,000 in the academic year between 2029 and 2030, according to the Russell Group of 24 leading British research universities.\n",
      "At the same time, the promise of a university education has become increasingly tenuous for students. During Britain’s national lockdowns students were banned from campuses and learning was confined to virtual Zoom and Microsoft Teams meetings, with in-person lectures only gradually returning at many institutions long after restrictions were ended.\n",
      "Universities are now facing a wave of legal action from graduates who paid full price for online teaching.\n",
      "The University and College Union is in its fifth year of industrial action, which has lost students hundreds of thousands of teaching hours. The union’s latest tactic, a boycott of marking assessments, has seen scores of students graduating without a degree this year.\n",
      "Striking lecturers have argued that revenue earned by universities is not being reflected in their wages, while senior leadership at many institutions preside over six-figure salaries. In February, universities and unions agreed to bring forward a pay settlement for next academic year, worth 5 to 8pc, in recognition of “urgent inflationary pressures” facing staff.\n",
      "The Blair-era expansion\n",
      "Following Labour’s landslide victory in 1997, the government inherited a university system that only took in a minority of school leavers.\n",
      "Approximately 20pc of English students went on to study at university by the age of 30 at the start of the decade. Earning a degree was seen largely as a preserve of the country’s elite, even with the ambitious reforms enacted by Sir John Major, which abolished the divide between the polytechnics and universities.\n",
      "Baroness Estelle Morris, who as education secretary oversaw part of New Labour’s expansion of higher education between 2001 and 2002, said that critics today have “legitimate” questions about the reforms, which have since allowed millions more people to hold degrees.\n",
      "“I’m not uncritical. I am absolutely not saying that every course that was started during this period of expansion was worth doing. [However] I cannot see one single argument against having half of our people having studied to degree level.\n",
      "“To be honest if you freeze the number I don’t think the middle classes were going to stop their children going to university. I don’t know how you change the social mix or widen participation if you kept the numbers as they were.\n",
      "“I think this question about the expansion of higher education is legitimate. I think there’s a legitimate argument there… but we needed more people achieving that degree level.” She said the Government should have pursued alternative paths to degree level qualifications, such as diplomas, which don’t require going to university.\n",
      "“If you’re working really hard to raise standards in schools you need a destination for the children who are doing better than they did before. When I visit schools I try not to ask youngsters questions that assume they were going to university. If I asked them 20 years ago I probably would ask that.\n",
      "She said that alternatives to university, such as apprenticeships, have provided good career paths that do not require taking on debt but that they lacked the life experience that university offers.\n",
      "“One of the things I worry a little bit about is I can’t think of any other post-18 study that provides that [experience]. You don’t get that university life. Children from poorer backgrounds now because of the debt they have they’re not leaving home. I worry that the children of the more affluent will still get that lifestyle and those from poorer backgrounds won’t leave home because they can’t afford it.\n",
      "She added: “We also thought that there needed to be more diversity in degree level provision. We talked about a two year course with less holidays. We talked about employers sponsoring their employees to go to university.”\n",
      "Debt woes\n",
      "Drawing in ever-increasing numbers of students has turned higher education into a booming business. Universities in England contribute around £95bn to the economy and support more than 815,000 jobs, according to consultancy Frontier Economics.\n",
      "Yet the surge in wealth generated by higher education providers has come under the backdrop of a mountain of student debt accumulated by generations of graduates. Between 2022 and 2023, student debt surpassed £200bn, according to data from the Student Loans Company. Despite the growth of the sector to become a pillar of the British economy, average earnings of both graduates and postgraduates have been steadily declining since 2007, data from the Department of Education shows.\n",
      "Russell Group vice chancellors handed themselves a 6pc pay rise last year, making the average salary £413,000 a year, amidst protests from lecturers in response to a proposed 3pc pay offer, according to analysis of published accounts by The Sunday Times.\n",
      "Imperial College London topped salary rankings for its outgoing president Alice Gast, who received a 35.5pc payrise to £714,000 last July.\n",
      "During the Covid-19 pandemic, Russell Group universities were revealed by The Telegraph to have amassed a £2.2bn cash surplus as a result of spiralling grade inflation, which saw school-leavers gaining record places at the institutions after cancelled exams meant they were handed their predicted grades in lieu of results.\n",
      "Alarm bells are now ringing over the quality of some degrees. Rishi Sunak, the Prime Minister, recently warned that some students were being “ripped off” by institutions over degrees that do not lead to decent salaried jobs and has announced plans for the universities regulator, the Office for Students, to take future earnings into account when deciding whether degrees were failing participants.\n",
      "Nick Hillman, director of the Higher Education Policy Institute, said: “I personally think that some of the focus the Government and regulator have put on quality is right. The alternatives to university are pretty few and far between. The cohort graduating this summer have had a pretty torrid time. They’ve been plagued by industrial action [and] they’ve been through Covid.\n",
      "“Some of those courses… creative arts courses and some business courses have very low wage returns. People who do fine art at university are not expecting to be millionaires. They are doing it for the love of the subject.\n",
      "“People who say too many people are going to university say ‘do vocational courses’, but business and art are vocational courses. So they are saying [both] don’t do a vocational course, [and] do a vocational course.\n",
      "“I personally think university is still very much worth doing for most people. It doesn’t work out for everybody. [However] All the evidence about the likelihood of being unemployed during the financial crisis or the covid crisis suggests having a degree on average stands you in pretty good stead.\n",
      "He added: “I also think there are a lot of people that now insist you have a degree. If you want to be a nurse you basically need a degree. Policing was moving in that direction for a bit. Teaching never used to be a graduate profession.”\n",
      "Sam Freedman, a senior fellow at the Institute for Government, another think-tank, said: “The big thing that would change the view at the moment is if the employers change their practices.\n",
      "“It’s really driven by the labour market. There are so many jobs that are graduate only, if more of those jobs became accessible to people who didn’t have degrees I think the dynamics would change quite quickly.”\n",
      "“One thing that hasn’t been talked about much is that the loan cost is going to get quite a lot more expensive from September. I think that may have an impact over time on people’s view of affordability. Under Blair and Cameron the tuition fees repayment structure was generous but not too burdensome in terms of when you had to start paying off with your salary.\n",
      "“Now the cutoff rate has been extended [from 30 to 40 years before being written off] and repaying back from a lower salary, so the amount graduates are paying back overtime is getting higher. It’s just going to be more burdensome and more noticeable early in your career. It’s going to be from £25,000, which most graduates will earn pretty early.\n",
      "He added: “For most young people it will still be worth doing a degree. The growth in university admissions over a very long time has been driven by very high demand from students and parents who know there is a wage premium. If it stopped being true you would see that demand drop away.\n",
      "The latest “Plan 5” student loans, due to apply to students going to university from September 2023, will see the threshold at which graduates start repaying debt drop to earnings above £25,000 a year, down from the old threshold of £27,295. The period after which loans are written off, currently 30 years, will rise to 40, meaning graduates will pay more for longer and in total.\n",
      "Graduates pay 9pc of their income above the threshold (on top of the usual income tax and National Insurance). Hargreaves Lansdown said a student starting a three-year degrees today could expect to graduate with a student loan of up to £61,000.\n",
      "Broken dreams\n",
      "When Andy Davis, who left Britain to live in Canada for five years to work in aviation, sent his daughter to study at Durham University in 2019 he earmarked £10,000 a year from his savings to support her studies.\n",
      "“My daughter has always been a hard worker and a high-achiever. I was looking forward to seeing her graduate with a degree, most likely a First. Covid was so hard for her, she started university at Durham in September 2019, so suffered from isolation and loneliness when lockdowns commenced in early 2020.\n",
      "“This was a hard time for all the students there and teaching staff seemed to have a longer Covid break than the rest of the country. However, no fees were ever returned.”\n",
      "He said that his daughter, who graduated without her degree certificate this summer due to the marking boycott, faces “ridiculous state of affairs” as she waits to find out what degree she will be awarded.\n",
      "“Strikes took place earlier in the year and have been rectified with large pay rises. This action appears to me to be pointless and made without any thought of these students who had to cope with a two year interruption to their university lives.”\n",
      "At the time Durham University said it was “deeply disappointing” that some of its staff had taken part in the the marking boycott.\n",
      "Emily Bell, a English Literature graduate at the University of Glasgow who received her final result without having all of her work marked, said: “I handed in my final assignment ten days after it [the marking boycott] started. I got my degree classification after the deadline for them to return stuff, I got my dissertation after that and really weak feedback on how it was written.\n",
      "“No-one was as excited [to graduate] as we expected. It was so anticlimactic.”\n",
      "Ollie Lewis, who graduated from the University of Edinburgh this summer, was handed little more than an apology during the ceremony. “What a shambles this all is. Walking across the graduation stage to be handed a measly apology letter was, to put it mildly, very disappointing.\n",
      "“Four years of work and nearly £40,000 worth of fees ended with a graduation ceremony which featured parents shouting “resign” at senior management and countless student protests. I think trust has completely broken down between universities across the UK and students, including potential future students.\n",
      "“Why should anyone believe that they will be given a degree on time in the future? Whatever the difficulties of this industrial dispute, universities have failed students and there will now be considerable clamour for compensation.”\n",
      "Those entering the workforce this year, or returning to university for further study, will have become accustomed to the uncertainty that comes with being a student in Britain today.\n",
      "From career prospects and finding ways to stand out in a crowded field of qualified graduates, to the cost of repaying loans, which surpassed £1,000 a year for the average graduate for the first time last year according to Hargreaves Lansdown, university degrees are a life-long financial commitment that appear to be losing their ability to change lives for the better.\n",

      "O'Rourke, who ran for the Democratic presidential nomination in 2020 and governor in 2022, urged the White House to unleash the full power of the federal government against Abbott. Abbott has sent more than 10,000 soldiers and police to the border since 2021 to respond to a record-high number of illegal crossings from Mexico, which he said Biden has not done enough to stop.\n",

We need to operate it correctly in the eyes of God,” the trooper wrote. “We need to recognize that these are people who are made in the image of God and need to be treated as such.”\n",
      "O'Rourke's plea Wednesday was a follow-up to his initial call on Monday for Washington to take action.\n",

Stop him from deploying razor wire & medieval drowning devices designed to ensnare & mutilate,\" O'Rourke wrote in a tweet Monday. \"Stop every illegal thing he’s doing on the border that ends up killing human beings. Mr. President, we need you to act.\"\n",
      "Internal communications from DPS showed that the trooper's email was forwarded throughout the department for two weeks as officials debated how to handle the concerns.\n",
      "DPS spokesman Travis Considine on Tuesday defended the state's actions.\n",
      "“There is not a directive or policy that instructs Troopers to withhold water from migrants or push them back into the river,\" Considine wrote in an email.\n",
      "DPS Director Steve McCraw responded multiple times, including calling for an audit of the department's policies. The DPS inspector general has formally launched an investigation into a trooper’s claims.\n",
      "The trooper's email stated that he had been working on June 25 when he encountered “120 people camped out along the fence line,” including small children and nursing babies. The trooper said he was twice given orders to \"push people back into the water to go to Mexico.\"\n",
      "On June 30, a 4-year-old girl who tried to cross the wire was “pressed back” by Texas National Guard soldiers “due to the orders given to them.” The girl fainted shortly after and was then extricated and transferred to the trooper for emergency care, according to the account.\n",
      "That same day, the trooper treated an adult man who had a large laceration on his leg from trying to free a child on top of a “trap” in the river and, in doing so, cut his leg open. DHS provided various pictures of the wounded immigrants.\n",
      "The trooper's email listed a boy who broke his leg and a 19-year-old pregnant woman \"doubled over\" in the wire and in “obvious pain” as she had a miscarriage.\n",
      "The following day, Border Patrol informed the trooper of a separate incident in which a mother and two children drowned trying to cross the river, which the trooper stated was because the casualty wire “forces people to cross in other areas that are deeper.”\n",
      "The injuries have not stopped since then. In the first two weeks of July, Border Patrol’s Del Rio, Texas, regional office listed six incidents in which immigrants who crossed the border illegally were injured and received elevated medical care as a result of trying to pass through circular concertina wire along the U.S. shoreline.\n",

      "Distributed the risk\n",
      "Additionally, Dickinson said that by having a constellation of distributed satellites, it was more difficult for Russia to take countermeasures.\n",
      "\"Having a megaconstellation, quite frankly, frustrates our adversaries,\" he said, \"because you don't know how many satellites it would take to have any kind of a degradation to that architecture, or which one if you had to pick one, you would have to, you know, have an effect against.\"\n",
      "Last October a deputy director in Russia's foreign ministry, Konstantin Vorontsov, said the use of Western commercial satellites by Ukraine established \"an extremely dangerous trend.\" While Vorontsov did not specifically name any satellites, he almost certainly was referring to SpaceX's Starlink satellite constellation, which has been used by Ukrainian soldiers for communications and for tracking Russian troop and tank movements.\n",
      "The use of civilian satellites for wartime purposes, Vorontsov said, essentially made them military targets. Dickinson was asked how Space Command would respond to an attack on a US commercial satellite by a foreign adversary. Basically, he punted on the question.\n",
      "\"I do have a mission area protecting and defending, and that's widely known, assets on orbit,\" he replied. \"But to be honest with you, those have to be directed to me by, you know, my boss, and my boss's boss, eventually if that were to happen.\"\n",
      "At the time that US Space Command was reestablished in 2019, Dickinson said the organization was tracking about 25,000 objects in space—active and defunct satellites, as well as old rocket stages, debris, and more. Now that number is close to 50,000, he said. Some of this is due to the increasing number of satellites, but a large amount has been caused by activities such as Russia's anti-satellite test in 2021.\n",
      "Striking a balance\n",
      "Dickinson said that some of this growth has come down to new objects identified and tracked by commercial providers. At present, he said, Space Command works with 133 commercial space companies, which are performing various functions from satellite communications to space domain awareness. He said these partnerships have proven potent in enhancing the capabilities of the US Department of Defense.\n",
      "But does this increasing reliance on commercial companies—which have their own priorities and at times mercurial leadership—not also threaten the ability of Space Command to do its job? What if a company decided that it no longer wanted its products to be used as part of the military's warfighting capabilities?\n",
      "\"It's a balance,\" Dickinson said. \"In other words, we're not going to be all commercial. We may not be all military. But as we look at our mission areas within US Space Command and the Department of Defense, there is a balance between what is purely military and what might be relied upon as a service.\"\n",
      "Already, he said, the US military relies heavily on commercial services in other domains, such as at sea, for shipping, and in the air, such as using commercial aircraft for some legs of troop deployments. Still, he acknowledged, space is a relatively new domain, and the extent to which the military relies on commercial services for its duties is still being worked out.\n",

      "Sample 17\n",
      "Original Article : The Canadian government used an opaque U.S. military sales program to provide Saudi Arabia with billions of dollars worth of armoured vehicles, some of which were shipped out urgently after the Kingdom joined the war in Yemen, according to government documents and an arms sales database consulted by The Breach.\n",
      "It’s the second-largest weapons export deal in Canadian history. But the Saudi clients have never been disclosed by the Canadian government. Nor has the fact been reported that the deal was struck at the behest of a U.S. plan to beef up the Saudi military.\n",
      "In 2009, under former prime minister Stephen Harper, a Canadian crown corporation signed a deal on behalf of weapons manufacturer General Dynamics Land Systems-Canada to provide 724 light armoured vehicles (LAVs) to Saudi Arabia. Government documents show that, as late as 2018, deliveries of the $2.9-billion worth of LAVs were still being fulfilled.\n",
      "The vehicles manufactured in Canada were of the same make later seen being used in Saudi Arabia’s operations in Yemen for years.\n",
      "The documents provide more evidence that the Canadian government may have knowingly supplied armoured vehicles for use in Yemen.\n",
      "The government documents, obtained through an access-to-information request, indicate that Canada was shipping new vehicles to the Saudi National Guard for at least three years during the war. The Saudi National Guard is considered to be the Kingdom’s best-equipped ground force and was directly engaged in the one-sided conflict that killed hundreds of thousands of Yemenis.\n",
      "The Breach can also reveal that Canadian companies signed subsequent contracts to maintain the vehicles until at least 2025, according to U.S. Department of Defense procurement records. These contracts involve repairing vehicles that appear to have been damaged during Saudi military operations in Yemen.\n",
      "The 2009 deal’s details have been shrouded in mystery because of Canada’s lack of transparency about its arms dealings, including those that go through the U.S. Foreign Military Sales (FMS) program, the program that supplied Saudi forces with the weapons.\n",
      "For decades, the program has integrated Canadian weapons production into American sales abroad, ensuring that the industry caters to the strategic needs of U.S. foreign policy.\n",
      "Massive weapons deal flies under the radar\n",
      "The lack of attention paid to the massive 2009 deal contrasts with the spotlight on another weapons deal.\n",
      "A $14-billion deal signed in 2014 for a newer model of armoured vehicles—the largest such deal in Canadian history—was the subject of considerable press coverage and criticism from human rights groups.\n",
      "But Canada’s second-largest weapons deal, signed five years earlier, has flown under the radar.\n",
      "Arranged by a crown corporation that markets Canadian weapons to foreign buyers, it was run through the FMS program, one of the main avenues the U.S. Department of Defense uses to supply weapons to allied and friendly regimes.\n",
      "Saudi Arabia is one of the largest customers of the FMS program and one of the largest clients of weapons from the U.S.\n",
      "Canada’s 2009 deal was tied to the U.S. government’s “modernization” of the Saudi Arabian National Guard.\n",
      "In 2011, another contract for a further 82 LAVs was signed through the same program. A U.S. Department of Defense news release announcing that contract said the sale would “contribute to the foreign policy and national security of the United States” and bolster “political stability and economic progress in the Middle East.”\n",
      "For decades, this office has attached several U.S. Army officials to the National Guard, funded by Saudi Arabia.\n",
      "In internal memos dated Nov. 29, 2018, obtained by The Breach, Canadian officials lauded this arrangement’s benefit to Canada, calling it “one of the rare examples of [Canada-U.S.] partnership in foreign military sales involving the export of full systems from Canada via FMS…that date[s] back to the 1980s.”\n",
      "A Breach investigation earlier this year revealed that the Canadian government believes its weapons sales to Saudi Arabia are crucial to maintaining the regime as an “integral and valued security partner,” listing access to oil, opportunities for Canadian companies and reduced need for Western military missions as its rationale.\n",
      "Saudis deploy the same vehicles in Yemen war\n",
      "During the eight-year war, Saudi forces deployed the same model of LAV that Canada provided in combat operations across the northern regions of Yemen.\n",
      "The Canadian LAVs seen operating in Yemen, the LAV-25 and its derivatives, are the older model of vehicle shipped under multiple contracts, with the largest being the 2009 FMS deal.\n",
      "The LAV-25 model has been identified in images and videos posted from Yemen by weapons monitors and open-source researchers analyzing the proliferation of arms in the Yemeni conflict. Following an August 2019 Houthi attack on Saudi forces in Yemen’s northern Kitaf region, numerous LAV-25s were identified by experts in images of torched Saudi LAV columns.\n",
      "Under the larger 2014 contract, Canada supplied a newer make of armoured vehicles that have not been seen operating in Yemen—the LAV-700—to the Saudi Royal Guard, a different unit in the Saudi military forces.\n",
      "The new documents obtained by The Breach raise questions as to whether or not Canada knowingly supplied LAV-25s for use against Yemen’s Houthi rebels.\n",
      "In July 2015, just four months after the war in Yemen began, then-minister of foreign affairs Rob Nicholson approved “urgent” export permits for an undisclosed number of “[LAVs] and weapon systems to Saudi Arabia,” according to a memo that was included in the documents obtained by The Breach.\n",
      "Further documents reveal that in September 2017, while the war was ongoing, Prime Minister Justin Trudeau’s government also received “urgent” export applications from General Dynamics Land Systems-Canada for LAV exports to Saudi Arabia. These applications specifically referenced LAVs being sent to the Saudi National Guard through FMS, one of the documents obtained by The Breach shows.\n",
      "Global Affairs Canada has flip-flopped on whether or not Canadian weapons have been used in the Yemen conflict. Most recently, the department made the blanket claim that “there are no confirmed reports of Canadian-made military equipment being deployed by Saudi Arabia on Yemeni territory.”\n",
      "Due to the Saudi-led Coalition’s record of violating international humanitarian law during the conflict, Canada’s provision of LAVs to the Kingdom constitutes a breach of its obligations under the Arms Trade Treaty.\n",
      "According to the monitoring website Lost Armour, which tracks major military equipment destroyed during conflict, at least 61 LAV-25s and its variants were seized or destroyed by Yemeni rebels during the course of the war.\n",
      "Canadian-made LAV-25s have also been diverted to the Saudi’s puppet Yemeni government, as detailed in an investigation by Arab Reporters for Investigative Journalism in 2019. Credible allegations of diversion legally require action by Canadian officials, but Global Affairs Canada would not tell the reporters how much evidence it would need to actually open an investigation.\n",
      "Canadians continue to service the Saudis\n",
      "General Dynamics Land Systems-Canada has continued to maintain, test and repair the fleet of LAVs provided by Canada through the 2009 deal.\n",
      "According to U.S. Department of Defense federal procurement records accessed by The Breach via the Tech Inquiry database, Canadian technicians have already been carrying out maintenance work on Saudi Arabia’s fleet of LAVs provided through the FMS program.\n",
      "This work is being performed by General Dynamics Land Systems-Canada technicians in Saudi Arabia.\n",
      "Their servicing contracts, set to run until at least 2025, appear to have involved maintaining the Saudi National Guard’s LAV fleet after damages were incurred during operations within Yemen.\n",
      "Large arms deals, and particularly those conducted through the FMS program, typically come with long-term servicing contracts.\n",
      "Stefano Trevisan, a Geneva-based attorney at law and international expert on the regulation of post-sale services on arms contracts, said these crucial deals have “escaped scrutiny.”\n",
      "“Maintenance is as fundamental as oil to [the running] of a tank. It is the same essential contribution,” he told The Breach. “Such services create long-term structural dependency between Western supplying states and multinational corporations and some of the world’s most repressive regimes.”\n",
      "Trevisan suggests that the nebulous and sometimes intangible nature of post-sale servicing leads to a lower profile of these arms deals.\n",
      "“These deals can go on for ten years” with little visibility, said Trevisan, who likens the relationship between original manufacturer and recipient to an “invisible link.”\n",
      "The Canadian manufacturer enjoys a monopoly on this service work because it has been described by the U.S. Army as the only outfit possessing “the knowledge and expertise necessary” to fulfill the requirements of these awards.\n",
      "Canadian officials have only acknowledged these sustainment contracts internally.\n",
      "In March 2021, according to the documents obtained by The Breach, Global Affairs Canada staffers requested export authorizations for “4 active contracts with the U.S. FMS for the supply of LAVs and related products and services to Saudi Arabia.”\n",
      "The documents noted the contracts “date back to 2009,” and were for “ancillary products/services (e.g. spare parts)” connected to the Saudi LAV program.\n",
      "Canada’s ‘dependency’ on the U.S. weapons export pipeline\n",
      "With the exception of the 2014 contract to supply the Saudi Royal Guard with Canadian LAVs, all other Canadian LAV contracts to the government of Saudi Arabia have been undertaken through the FMS program, dating back to the first deliveries in 1991.\n",
      "At any given time, there are hundreds of billions of dollars worth of active U.S. FMS contracts to more than 180 countries.\n",
      "Jack Poulson, executive director of Tech Inquiry and a former senior data scientist at Google, told The Breach that Saudi Arabia is one of the most interesting examples of how the U.S. government aims to satisfy its foreign policy objectives by arming foreign states.\n",
      "“As part of the U.S. government’s alignment with countries such as Israel and Saudi Arabia against Iran, U.S. defense contractors sell Saudi Arabia about $10 billion per year of missile defense, Black Hawk helicopters, M1 Abrams tanks, etc.” Poulson told The Breach by email.\n",
      "The FMS program also operates as both diplomatic carrot and stick: those who stay in the good graces of the U.S. foreign policy machine continue to benefit from the program, while those who deviate run the risk of losing access to advanced Western-produced weaponry.\n",
      "The program is viewed by the Canadian government as a conduit to get Canadian military goods to the international market, openly extolled as providing new potential business lines for Canadian arms manufacturers.\n",
      "The Canadian Commercial Corporation, the federal body which brokered the LAV deals, has said in its corporate plans that “Canadian exporters are able to leverage the U.S. Foreign Military Sales (FMS) program [as a means to] sell into the U.S. DoD inventory where their goods can then be re-sold to third party countries.”\n",
      "Ernie Regehr, co-founder of Project Ploughshares and author of Arms Canada: The Deadly Business of Military Exports, explained to The Breach via email that Canada’s defence industry is “heavily dependent” on the U.S.\n",
      "Regehr explained that Canada’s defence dependency dates back to the 1950s Defence Production Sharing Agreement. That agreement stipulated that Canada’s Department of National Defence would look to procure major weapons systems from American suppliers and, in turn, Canadian manufacturers would be granted preferential access in selling military goods to the American government.\n",
      "“Allowing Canada access to the U.S. defence market was a small price for the U.S. to pay…to reinforce Canadian policy dependence on the U.S.,” Regehr said.\n",
      "“Ever since, the dominant narrative has been that Canada can’t manage its own security, with substantial elements of the defence policy community relentlessly proposing further security integration with the U.S.”\n",
      "Domestic arms production is frequently justified on the grounds that local producers can easily supply a nation’s armed forces in the event of armed conflict. However, most arms-exporting states stake a claim on one corner of the market by developing a production niche that soon needs foreign clients to stay profitable.\n",
      "Canada is no exception, Regehr said.\n",
      "“Aircraft engines, armoured vehicles and rifles are all examples of Canadian military production [that became] dependent on international sales in order to sustain the Canadian production facility,” he said, pointing out that all of these facilities are also Canadian-based subsidiaries of larger American-owned multinationals.\n",
      "“[A]rmoured vehicles and automatic rifles were initially built for the Canadian Forces, but the Canadian market was too small to sustain the plants, and hence they developed a reliance on exports to foreign military forces.”\n",
      "General Dynamics Land Systems-Canada was forced to look for foreign, non-American clients following the end of export contracts to the U.S. in the 1980s.\n",
      "The client that ultimately saved the supplier was Saudi Arabia, with contract negotiations for its first major LAV procurement contract being finalized in 1990, and later delivered through the FMS program.\n",
      "According to archival documents made available by the Canadian government, officials from the U.S. Army’s Office of the Program Manager first visited factories in London in 1981, spurring initial Saudi interest in vehicles from Canada.\n",
      "Deliveries of LAVs to the Saudi Royal Guard under the $14-billion contract are likely moving into the final stages.\n",
      "This contract will then, too, move into long-term maintenance, about which little information is available.\n",
      "The terms of the contract have never been released to the public, despite the fact that the federal government signed the deal on behalf of the vehicle manufacturer.\n",

      "Original Article : Fulton County prosecutors are asking the public to wait a little longer to review the final report issued by a special grand jury that investigated interference in Georgia’s 2020 election.\n",
      "With just weeks until Fulton District Attorney Fani Willis is expected to seek indictments against former President Donald Trump and others, her office asked the Georgia Court of Appeals on Monday to block release of the report “at least until final charging decisions have been made.” In their report, the grand jurors recommended multiple people be criminally charged, several members previously told The Atlanta Journal-Constitution.\n",
      "Donald Wakeford, one of Willis’s deputies, wrote, “if a special purpose grand jury’s report, requested by and intended for a district attorney’s evaluation, became a presumptively public court record with immediate effect, a prosecutor’s use of a special purpose grand jury would risk revealing information which would otherwise remain protected until the termination of the case in any other criminal investigatory context.”\n",
      "The filing came in response to an appeal filed by a coalition of media organizations, including The Atlanta Journal-Constitution, which argued that the report was a court record subject to disclosure and that the public interest demanded that the full document be released. The outlets asked the court to overturn a February decision from Fulton Superior Court Judge Robert McBurney in which he ruled that the rights of future defendants needed to be protected, even though grand jurors had requested that their recommendations be made public.\n",
      "“There was very limited due process in this process for those who might now be named as indictment-worthy in the final report,” McBurney wrote.\n",
      "The special grand jury met for nearly eight months between May 2022 and January 2023, hearing testimony from about 75 witnesses and collecting evidence for Willis. The investigative body did not have the power to issue indictments.\n",
      "In February, McBurney released a redacted portion of the final report, which excluded the special grand jury’s list for who should be charged with various state crimes.\n",
      "The redacted version of the report did include a few notable disclosures, including that jurors were in unanimous agreement that there was no evidence of widespread fraud in Georgia’s 2020 elections. It also stated that a majority of jurors had recommended that prosecutors pursue perjury charges against at least one witness they believe lied under oath in their testimony.\n",

Nagorno-Karabakh and its residents have once again been cut off from essential supplies after Azerbaijan suspends road traffic on the only road linking Armenia and Nagorno-Karabakh. For months, between December 2022 and April 2023, environmentalists from Azerbaijan — allegedly linked to the government — were blocking the Lachin Corridor, the only route connecting Armenia to Karabakh across the territory of Azerbaijan. Then on April 28, 2023, the so-called “eco-activists” suspended their blockade following the installation of an Azerbaijani border checkpoint on the corridor. However, since mid-June, no supplies have been allowed past the Azerbaijani checkpoint, and gas supplies have been once again cut off from the region. Azerbaijan has also blocked International Red Cross vehicles from entering the region, citing “contraband” prevention measures. On July 14, thousands of Armenians gathered in Stepanakert (Khankendi in Azerbaijani), Nagorno-Karabakh's capital, and marched to the ICRC office in the city and the Russian peacekeeper base on the city’s outskirts, reported OC Media.\n",
      "Lachin blockade\n",
      "Armenia and Azerbaijan may have fought a war two years ago and signed an agreement to end hostilities, but tensions between the two countries over the Karabakh region linger. When the blockade began in December, at first, the protesters demanded Armenia stop the illegal mining in Karabakh and prevent the transfer of minerals into the country. However, in the following days, the demands changed. According to reporting by Radio Liberty at the time, the protesters’ demands changed to “Baku establish control over the Lachin Corridor.”\n",
      "The border checkpoint set up by Azerbaijan is viewed as a way to better facilitate the blockade of Nagorno Karabakh. Azerbaijan holds the upper hand in screening any vehicle traveling between Armenia and Nagorno Karabakh. Reports that residents were being screened by the Azerbaijani border troops emerged on May 1. According to reports, footage appeared to show Armenian vehicles passing through the checkpoint, with Azerbaijani border control officers inspecting their vehicles and documents.\n",
      "“The people are from villages near the checkpoint under double blockade and were traveling with the support of peacekeepers, with guarantees of not being bothered,” wrote Artak Beglaryan, an adviser to the State Minister, on Twitter at the time when the checkpoint was set up.\n",

      "But while the leaders discussed some of the pressing points of reaching a final peace deal, there has been little sign of progress on the “most difficult issue — the fate of ethnic Armenians in Nagorno-Karabakh,” wrote Olesya Vartanyan, an analyst with the International Crisis Group, an independent organization that works to prevent wars and shape policies.\n",
      "The Nagorno-Karabakh area has been under the control of its ethnic Armenian population as a self-declared state since a war fought in the early 1990s, which ended with a ceasefire and Armenian military victory in 1994. In the aftermath of the first war, a new, internationally unrecognized, de facto Nagorno-Karabakh Republic was established. Seven adjacent regions were occupied by the Armenian forces. As a result of that war, “more than a million people had been forced from their homes: Azerbaijanis fled Armenia, Nagorno-Karabakh, and the adjacent territories, while Armenians left homes in Azerbaijan,” according to the International Crisis Group. Following the second Karabakh war in 2020, Azerbaijan regained control over much of the previously occupied seven regions. Azerbaijan also captured one-third of Karabakh itself during the war. On November 10, 2020, Armenia and Azerbaijan signed a ceasefire agreement brokered by Russia.\n",
      "According to Vartanyan, although significant progress was made in talks between the two nations in light of Armenian leadership's “significant concessions” since the end of hostilities in 2020, the fate of ethnic Armenians in Nagorno-Karabakh remains unclear. “Armenia is insisting it includes special rights and ensures the security of Nagorno-Karabakh’s Armenian population. International mediators also want special measures due to decades of conflict and the recent 2020 war that claimed over 7,000 lives in just six weeks,” wrote the analyst.\n",
      "Azerbaijan has yet to produce a document outlining its next steps regarding the ethnic Armenian population. Speaking to Reuters, Azerbaijan's Foreign Minister Jeyhun Bayramov said guarantees for ethnic Armenians were not negotiable as this would amount to interfering with Azerbaijan's internal politics. “This is an internal, sovereign issue. The Azerbaijan constitution and a number of international conventions to which Azerbaijan is party provide all the necessary conditions in order to guarantee the rights of this population,” said Bayramov.\n",
      "In an interview with Politico, Tigran Grigoryan, a political analyst and the director of the Regional Center for Democracy and Security in Yerevan, said if faced with a choice, the local Armenian population will “choose to leave” rather than “accept [Azerbaijani] passports.”\n",
      "A recent International Crisis Group report published in May 2023 explains how the new checkpoint is viewed among the local Nagorno Karabakh residents:\n",
      "[Ethnic Armenians in Nagorno-Karabakh] worry that the checkpoint’s imposition represents a form or muscle flexing that could be the precursor to ethnic cleansing. This move unsettles the ethnic Armenians, who cite a violent history – in particular, Azerbaijani-orchestrated attacks on ethnic Armenians in the late 1980s – that leads them to equate Azerbaijani control with oppression. Indeed, both Azerbaijanis and Armenians harbor bitter memories of being forced to flee areas controlled by the other group in the wake of conflict and for fear of additional bloodshed.\n",
      "The new round of blockade has given Azerbaijan an upper hand at the negotiation table over peace agreements as well. Speaking to Eurasianet, Zaur Shiriyev, an analyst with the International Crisis Group, “Simply put, Baku controls the Lachin road, meaning everything is in their hands, and while it remains a priority, it seems that there is no immediate urgency to reaching a peace agreement.”\n",
      "Despite the repeated international calls to end the blockade, official Baku is reluctant to lift the blockade. Meanwhile, reports of deadly clashes continue. And prospects for peace remain hanging by a thread.\n",

      "Original Article : The war in Ukraine is also a ‘food fight’\n",
      "In the 1930s, in a bid to pacify the still-unruly region of Ukraine, the Soviet leadership created a man-made famine on its territory. The consequences were horrific; between 1932 and 1933, an estimated 7 to 10 million Ukrainians died in the tragedy that has come to be known as the Holodomor.\n",
      "Today, as part of its war against Ukraine, the government in Moscow is wielding the food weapon once again. On Monday, the Kremlin announced that it was suspending its participation in the Black Sea Grain Initiative, and that it was no longer willing to guarantee the security of food exports transiting the Black Sea. The potential effects of this decision are both profound and profoundly destabilizing.\n",
      "To understand why, it’s necessary to appreciate the outsized role that Russia and Ukraine play in global food consumption. In 2021, the two countries provided a combined 34 percent of the world’s wheat, 27 percent of its barley, and 55 percent of its sunflower oil. All told, according to European estimates, they jointly accounted for nearly 12 percent of “food calories traded globally” that year.\n",
      "So when the Ukraine war broke out in early 2022, worries abounded that the result could very well be a global food crisis, as one of the participants in the conflict — and perhaps both — went offline as an international supplier. That did not happen, thanks largely to the Black Sea Grain Initiative. Inked a year ago this month between Russia, Turkey and the United Nations, it created a framework for the resumption of Ukrainian grain exports despite the war, staving off potentially disastrous food shortages and commodity shortfalls in the developing world.\n",
      "From the start, Moscow’s adherence to the deal was tentative at best, with the Kremlin committing only to short extensions and repeatedly threatening to abandon the arrangement altogether. In support of its position, it has woven an elaborate web of falsehoods, accusing the West of (among other things) hoarding food intended for developing nations and creating trade obstacles for Russia’s own exports.\n",
      "The real reasons for Russia’s intransigence are geopolitical in nature.\n",
      "The first is strategic. It didn’t take long for the government of Russian President Vladimir Putin to figure out that it could use food as a weapon to pressure the West just as it has long used its energy supplies. Ever since, Moscow has taken pains to manipulate the current global food crisis (in which nearly 350 million people worldwide are facing starvation) to its advantage.\n",
      "The second reason is economic. As the State Department has noted, Moscow has taken a series of measures to restrict its own exports of foodstuffs and fertilizer, thereby “profiteering” from a crisis it created itself by forcing global prices upward. By doing so, Russia has managed to soften the impact of Western sanctions on its economy, at least somewhat.\n",
      "The approach has reaped concrete dividends for the Kremlin. Even as they have sought to punish Moscow for its military aggression, Western nations have quietly tried to mollify it. To that end, the European Union recently floated a proposal for the Russian Agricultural Bank, which is currently under international sanctions, to be allowed to reconnect to the SWIFT global financial network as an inducement to keep Russia in the grain deal. (Moscow, however, didn’t bite.)\n",
      "Developing nations, meanwhile, have done even more. Eager for some sort of compromise that would allow “business as usual” to resume, thereby keeping their brittle economies afloat — and their restive populations fed — countries in the Global South have become de facto advocates for Russia. For instance, on the heels of his recent jaunt to Moscow, where he discussed food insecurity in Africa, South African president Cyril Ramaphosa flew to Kyiv and floated a 10-point peace plan extremely favorable to the Kremlin.\n",
      "Russia’s plan, clearly, is to raise the specter of food shortages (and political instability) as a way to turn world opinion against Ukraine, and to force Western nations to scale back their own campaign of pressure. By doing that, Putin believes, it might just be possible to eke out some sort of victory in his protracted and exceedingly troubled campaign against Kyiv. And increasingly, it looks like Russia’s president might be willing to foment an international food crisis in order to do so.\n",

      "Here's another reason to love the 'Barbie' star.\n",
      "It would be hard to choose anyone to be the \"person of the moment\" right now other than actress Margot Robbie. Her new film, “Barbie,” which she also produced, is currently at the top of the box office, well on its way to becoming the summer's biggest film.\n",
      "The publicity and excitement surrounding the “Barbie” star has caused a video to resurface showing that the A-list actress has a sweet side and knows a bit of sign language.\n",
      "In September of 2022, at the London premiere of “Amsterdam,” Robbie was interacting with fans when a deaf man handed her a piece of paper, which appeared to be a sign language cheat sheet. “For me?” the actress asked before exclaiming, “I know it!”\n",
      "Then she frantically looked for a place to set down the cheat sheet and some pens to free up her hands so she could show off her finger alphabet skills.\n",
      "In another angle of the same interaction, you can get a better glimpse of Robbie’s hand gestures and see how genuinely enthused she was to share this touching moment with the man. \"Nice to meet you,\" she appears to say to him after rifling through the alphabet.\n",
      "If you’re familiar with American Sign Language (ASL), you may have noticed that the signs Robbie and the fan use are a bit different. In the video, Robbie uses Auslan or Australian sign language, which is related to British Sign Language (BSL) and New Zealand Sign Language (NZSL). These three signed languages descended from the same parent language and are part of the BANZSL language family.\n",

      "Original Article : Rishi Sunak Warned Watering Down Net Zero \"Will Not Help\" Tory Party Prospects\n",
      "Prime Minister Rishi Sunak (Alamy)\n",
      "A co-author of the Conservative party's 2019 manifesto has urged Rishi Sunak to stick with the government's net zero pledge, warning that watering it down and indulging sceptics will not be a vote winner at the general election.\n",
      "Rachel Wolf, who wrote the party's general election-winning manifesto four years ago, and is now a founding partner at consultancy Public First, said there was a \"massive risk\" of ministers \"overinterpreting and misinterpreting\" the Tory party by-election win Uxbridge and South Ruislip, where debates about environmental policy dominated the campaign.\n",
      "The Conservatives' surprise win in the west London seat last week, where the Tories held onto Boris Johnson's former Uxbridge constituency with a majority of just 495, subsequently prompted a debate among Conservative MPs about whether the result was evidence that the public wants the government to dilute its plans for achieving net zero by the year 2050. Conservative campaigners had framed the vote for Tory candidate Steve Tuckwell to appeal to significant local opposition to London mayor Sadiq Khan expanding the Ultra Low Emissions Zone (ULEZ).\n",
      "Since that result, Conserative MPs on the right of the parliamentary party have called on the PM to rethink his strategy for tackling climate change. Jacob Rees Mogg, the former business secretary, said the Uxbridge result demonstrated the need for the Tory party to do away with \"unpopular, expensive green policies”.\n",
      "On Monday morning, Sunak said government would pursue the 2050 net zero target in a \"proportionate and pragmatic way\" which \"doesn’t unnecessarily give people more hassle and more costs\", casting doubt on his watertight commitment to the pledge. Sunak's spokesperson later added that mechanisms for hitting the net zero target, like the plan to outlaw the sale of petrol and diesel cars from the year 2030, were \"under review\".\n",
      "Levelling up secretary Michael Gove this morning later clarified that the 2030 ban was \"immovable\", but hinted that the phasing out of gas boilers could be slowed down.\n",
      "Wolf told PoliticsHome ministers would be wrong to interpret the Conservative victory in Uxbridge and South Ruislip last week as a vote against the net zero agenda, and urged the government to not get caught up in \"a big overreaction\".\n",
      "“There is a massive risk of overinterpreting and misinterpreting the Uxbridge result,\" she said.\n",
      "“There’s a big difference between a policy lke ULEZ, which people can see comes with very tangible costs and feel is unfair, which you can argue is true, and the general net zero policies, many of which don’t have those.\n",
      "\"More importantly, people remain very supportive of net zero and climate policy, and there have been lots of policies over the last twenty years that have come with costs but haven’t caused big electoral issues.\"\n",
      "She added that Public First polling has consistently found majority support for net zero across every voter group, \"whether it be red wall, older, younger or metropolitan voters\".\n",
      "\"It might not be their top priority, but they care about it,\" she said.\n",
      "“The government needs to be focused on what really matters to people and that is the economy, the cost of living, the National Health Service, crime, and the core areas where people want to see rapid progress on climate policy. They should not be filling the airwaves as net zero sceptics, which some people want them to do, as that is not going to help them.”\n",
      "There are Conservatives on the moderate wing of the parliamentary party who are privately exasperated with calls from some Tory back benchers for the Prime Minister to rethink net zero. One former secretary of state said the statements were \"lunacy\".\n",
      "Wolf was echoed by Adam Hawksbee, deputy director at cente-right think tank Onward, who said the government would be \"mad\" to water down its stance on achieving net zero.\n",
      "\"The public want action on the environment and energy, and they are unforgiving of politicians who break their promises,\" said Hawskbee, who warned that ditching net zero could cost the Conservative party a quarter of its current support and deter a significant number of potential voters at the next general election, which is set to take place in 2024.\n",
      "\"The important thing is that policies don't exacerbate the cost of living crisis – which is why we [Onward] called for the hydrogen levy on households to be scrapped, but also why we want increased investments in lower cost renewables,\" he told PoliticsHome.\n",
      "They were echoed by Craig Oliver, former 10 Downing Street director of communications for ex-prime minister David Cameron, who said \"history will take a dim view of politicians on all sides\" who back away from net zero \"because of a single by-election result\".\n",
      "Writing in The House, Oliver said: \"Trying to get our economy to net zero is an epic task. It will require creativity and bravery from politicians, educating us all and taking us through several pain barriers. It also requires both parties to form a consensus that the other will not overturn at the slightest whiff of electoral advantage.\"\n",
      "The Uxbridge result also triggered a row within Labour, with leader Keir Starmer urging mayor Khan to consider how ULEZ can be tweaked in light of the shock defeat. Danny Beales, the unsuccessful Labour candidate, described it as a \"bad policy\" which \"cut us off at the knees”.\n",
      "Oliver wrote: \"Would Clement Atlee and Margaret Thatcher have been so successful if they did not see part of their job as being educators and turned back at the first difficulty?\"\n",

      "ODESA, Ukraine (AP) — Russia struck the Ukrainian Black Sea city of Odesa on Sunday, keeping up a barrage of attacks that has damaged critical port infrastructure in southern Ukraine in the past week. At least one person was killed and 22 others wounded in the early morning attack, officials said.\n",
      "Four children were among those wounded in the blasts, which severely damaged 25 landmarks across the city, including the historic Transfiguration Cathedral.\n",
      "Russia has been launching repeated attacks on Odesa, a key hub for exporting grain, since Moscow canceled a landmark grain deal on Monday amid Kyiv’s grinding efforts to retake its occupied territories.\n",
      "After the fires were put out at the Orthodox cathedral, volunteers donned hard hats, shovels and brooms to begin removing rubble and try to salvage any artifacts — under the watchful gaze of the saints whose paintings remained intact. Local officials said the icon of the patroness of the city was retrieved from under the rubble.\n",
      "“The destruction is enormous, half of the cathedral is now roofless,” said Archdeacon Andrii Palchuk, as workers brought documents and valuables out of the building, its floor inundated with water used by firefighters to extinguish the blaze.\n",
      "Palchuk said the damage was caused by a direct hit from a Russian missile that penetrated the building down to the basement. Two people inside were wounded.\n",
      "“But with God’s help, we will restore it,” he said, bursting into tears.\n",
      "A woman who came to help with the cleanup said she loved the cathedral “for its tranquility and grace.”\n",
      "“When you enter this church, you feel like you’re beyond the world,” said Liudmyla, who gave only her first name. “I have a feeling that God, to protect apartments, took this pain, this explosion upon himself.”\n",
      "Anna Fetchenko, who came to Odesa for a volunteer meeting, also pitched in to clear the debris. “I wanted to go to the seaside, but last night was so frightening that I cried for the first time in 2023,” she said.\n",
      "“This is our Ukrainian heritage, and now it’s taken away from us.”\n",
      "Later Sunday, Palchuk urged people to gather in front of the destroyed part of the cathedral for an outdoor service and to pray in front of a sacred icon that “miraculously survived.”\n",
      "“We will pray that it protects us from the Russians,” he said.\n",
      "The cathedral belongs to the Ukrainian Orthodox Church, which has been accused of links to Russia. The church has insisted that it is loyal to Ukraine, has denounced the Russian invasion from the start and even declared its independence from Moscow.\n",
      "WATCH: Russia’s war in Ukraine leads to historic split in the Orthodox Church\n",
      "But Ukrainian security agencies have claimed that some in the Ukrainian church maintain close ties with Moscow. They’ve raided numerous church holy sites and posted photos of rubles, Russian passports and leaflets with messages from the Moscow patriarch as proof some church officials are loyal to Russia.\n",
      "UNESCO strongly condemned the attack on the cathedral and other heritage sites and said it will send a mission in coming days to assess damage. Odesa’s historic center was declared a UNESCO World Heritage site earlier this year, and the agency said the Russian attacks contradict Moscow’s pledge to take precautious to spare World Heritage sites in Ukraine.\n",
      "“This outrageous destruction marks an escalation of violence against the cultural heritage of Ukraine. I strongly condemn this attack against culture, and I urge the Russian Federation to take meaningful action to comply with its obligations under international law,” UNESCO Director-General Audrey Azoulay said in a statement.\n",
      "Regional Gov. Oleh Kiper said that six residential buildings were destroyed by the strikes.\n",
      "Some people were trapped in their apartments following the attack, which left rubble strewn in the street and partly blocking the road.\n",
      "Svitlana Molcharova, 85, was rescued by emergency workers. But after she received first aid, she refused to leave her destroyed apartment. “I will stay here,” she said.\n",
      "“I woke up when the ceiling started to fall on me. I rushed into the corridor,” said Ivan Kovalenko, a 19-year-old resident of the building. “That’s how I lost my home in Mykolaiv, and here, I lost my rented apartment.”\n",
      "His unit revealed a partially collapsed ceiling and a balcony that came off the side of the building. All the windows were blown out.\n",
      "Ukraine’s air force reported on the Telegram messaging app that Russia had launched 19 missiles in the Odesa region, including five high-precision winged Onyx missiles and four sea-to-shore Kalibr cruise missiles. It said that Ukrainian air defenses shot down nine.\n",
      "Russia’s Defense Ministry said Sunday its forces attacked sites in Odesa “where terrorist acts against the Russian Federation were being prepared.”\n",
      "In a later statement, the ministry denied that its attacks struck the Transfiguration Cathedral, claiming the destruction of the cathedral was likely due to “the fall of a Ukrainian anti-aircraft guided missile.”\n",
      "The attacks come days after President Vladimir Putin pulled Russia out of the Black Sea Grain Initiative, a wartime deal that enabled Ukraine’s exports to reach many countries facing the threat of hunger.\n",

      "Earlier Russian attacks have crippled significant parts of export facilities in Odesa and nearby Chornomorsk, and destroyed 60,000 tons of grain, according to Ukraine’s Agriculture Ministry.\n",
      "Putin vowed to retaliate against Kyiv for an attack Monday on the crucial Kerch Bridge linking Russia with the Crimean Peninsula, which the Kremlin illegally annexed in 2014.\n",
      "— Putin and Belarusian President Alexander Lukashenko were meeting Sunday in St. Petersburg, two days after Moscow warned Poland that any aggression against its neighbor and ally would be considered an attack on Russia. Putin said talks would also take place Monday, and declared that Kyiv’s counteroffensive had failed.\n",
      "Lukashenko said Wagner troops, who launched joint drills with the Belarusian military on Thursday, almost a month after their short-lived rebellion against Moscow, wanted to go west “on an excursion to Warsaw, to Rzeszow” in Poland, but that Belarus would not allow the mercenary force to relocate.\n",

      "Original Article : The Conservatives are in danger of underestimating the scale of their electoral predicament, political strategists have warned, as the cost of living crisis is forcing the party’s core voters to cancel holidays and leaving them in fear for their livelihoods.\n",
      "New focus group evidence on the economic plight of “Blue Wall” middle-class Tories has led one expert to predict that the party faces “electoral annihilation” if it fails to address the issue.\n",
      "Tory MPs have long held onto the hope that, with at least a year still to go until the general election, there will be enough time for the party to turn their fortunes around and secure an unlikely victory at the ballot box in 2024.\n",
      "Ministers regularly point to the remarkable feat of escapology carried out by John Major at the 1992 election, which saw the Conservatives clinch an unexpected win over a resurgent Labour party.\n",
      "But academics and political strategists have started to paint a very different outlook for the party as a result of what has been described as an “unprecedented” set of economic shocks that have caused fissures in the bedrock of traditional Tory support.\n",
      "Ed Dorrell, partner at political strategy firm Public First, recently carried out a series of focus groups of lower middle-class voters in the Home Counties, who voted for Boris Johnson in 2019, that will be a cause for significant concern for the Tory leadership.\n",
      "He said that the country will have a better sense of the Conservatives’ political situation after the by-election results this week, which he said “may yet give the Tories hope”, despite current polling.\n",
      "But he told i: “I get the impression that the Conservatives don’t yet seem to understand that the economy improving by 1 per cent will not have a huge tangible impact on people’s pockets – at least in the short or medium term. There is always a lag, particularly when it comes to how much people’s mortgages are, or how much they are paying for goods in the supermarket.\n",
      "“Prices will still be much higher than what they were, mortgage repayments will remain very high and wages are likely to lag behind.”\n",
      "Carrying out the focus group, he said he was struck by the gloomy prospects voiced by each of those taking part.\n",
      "“There are now lots of voters who should be instinctive Tories who feel very poor in a way they haven’t before. And instinctive Tories feeling poor is very bad news for the Conservatives,” Mr Dorrell said.\n",
      "“They are what I would call ‘Tebbit Tories’, who would admire Margaret Thatcher. These are people who have started their own small businesses, plumbing firms, electricians, who are now saying they are unsure how they will survive next year.”\n",
      "He said that some members had been forced to cancel their summer holiday abroad and highlighted one member taking part in the focus group, who admitted: “I now head to Aldi for bargains. The days of Waitrose are long gone.”\n",
      "Another focus group member said: “A couple of years ago I thought we were working quite hard and doing ok. Now I’m worried we might actually be poor.”\n",
      "Mr Dorrell believes this could have disastrous consequences for the government. “If the Tories are not careful, they’re looking at electoral annihilation,” he wrote in an article for the CapX website.\n",
      "The freefall in traditional Tory voters’ living standards coincides with the precipitous rise in interest rates, which has ramped up mortgage costs, while inflation has remained stubbornly high.\n",
      "Of particular concern for Rishi Sunak and his Chancellor Jeremy Hunt is that around one million mortgage holders will see their monthly mortgage costs increase by £500 by 2026, the equivalent of a £10,000 cut in people’s annual wages, going on assumptions of homeowners’ salaries based on the size of their mortgages.\n",
      "It means the mortgage pain being felt for homeowners, who are more likely to be Tory voters, will still be felt by the next election.\n",
      "“Few economists seem to believe that mortgage rates will start going down substantially by the time of the general election next year and could still be climbing,” Mr Dorrell told i. “Unless something miraculous happens for the Conservatives – or Keir Starmer somehow implodes – this will likely spell disaster for Rishi Sunak.”\n",
      "Despite this, some Tory MPs believe the mortgage crisis is either not affecting their constituents, or perhaps more surprisingly, being overplayed by the media.\n",
      "One Tory backbencher representing an outer London constituency told i: “The mortgage issue hasn’t been raised with my office at all, the new affordability checks introduced post-2008 seem to have worked in that households have been ‘stress tested’ against rises like we have seen already.”\n",
      "Although the MP added: “For new buyers who have lost cheap rates it’s incredibly frustrating.”\n",
      "The comments were echoed by a former minister in a Tory/Labour marginal in the South East, who insisted the issue was not being raised by their constituents.\n",
      "“Everyone understands the risks of rate rises when they take out a mortgage. It is entirely driven by the opposition and media,” the MP said.\n",
      "Others within the Government are holding out for a repeat of what happened in 1992, as they look for a narrow path to power next year.\n",
      "One Cabinet minister told i that the perception of both Mr Sunak and Sir Keir Starmer as being similar “responsible managers of the country” means voters may be willing to stick with the incumbent “because we think these guys will get us out of the economic mess”.\n",
      "“In ’92, we were in a recession and the economy was in a terrible bloody mess,” the Cabinet member said. “Norman Lamont was the chancellor, and yet people were frightened to make the change to [Neil] Kinnock.”\n",
      "According to Will Jennings, Professor of Political Science and Public Policy at the University of Southampton, said too many within Westminster can become “obsessed about drawing analogies rather than looking at what’s really going on”.\n",
      "“One difference was that John Major was actually quite popular, his approval ratings were around +4, despite his party being at -30, while Neil Kinnock was not popular and was polling behind where Keir Starmer is now,” Professor Jennings said.\n",
      "“But the bigger thing is the economic comparisons. The recession in 1992 was short and sharp. Recessions then were seen as reflecting the business cycle and did not hugely impact the reputation of the Conservative government.”\n",
      "He added the economic situation is fundamentally different. “We’re in a period of wage stagnation since 2008 that is exceptional. It is unprecedented. Whereas before this was offset by a lower cost of borrowing, now interest rates are going up and wages are not keeping up,” Professor Jennings said.\n",
      "What the Prime Minister and the Tory party can hope for is for voters to have short memories, and that by the general election next year people’s standard of living will not be any worse than now. “Maybe then they can sell a story that things are beginning to turn around.”\n",

      "Original Article : NASHVILLE, Tenn. -- Pausing at the microphone, 5-year-old Noah took a breath and softly stated, “I don't want any guns today or any day in my school.”\n",
      "His mom, Sarah Shoop Neumann, wiped away tears as she held the young boy. It had been more than four months since a shooter indiscriminately opened fire while Noah was at a private elementary school in Nashville, killing three of his schoolmates and three adults. And Neumann wanted action.\n",
      "Joining a group of families from The Covenant School, Neumann and others on Thursday announced that they had created two nonprofits to not only promote school safety and mental health resources, but also form an action fund to push legislative policy changes that would place certain limits on firearms inside the politically ruby red state of Tennessee.\n",
      "“We can create brighter tomorrows for our state so no other community has to endure the suffering,\" Neumann told reporters at a news conference. “And our children can go to school without fear.”\n",
      "The group's announcement is the latest development in the ongoing tension over whether Republican-dominant Tennessee will pass meaningful legislation in response to The Covenant School shooting. While gun control advocates have pushed for stricter regulations on firearms for years, these families are hoping to make greater strides with conservative lawmakers by using commonalities in their faith and, for some, their political backgrounds, while stressing the need to prevent future tragedies.\n",
      "Over the next few weeks, parents will meet at the state Capitol building every day to pray and meet with lawmakers.\n",
      "“As a native Tennessean and a gun owner, I think it’s important to emphasize we are proponents of responsible gun ownership,” said Melissa Alexander, a Covenant parent. “However, I think it’s important to intervene when there are clear signs that something is wrong.”\n",
      "The creation of the political advocacy fund helps clear the way for families to lobby lawmakers on their policy positions and collect donations. Yet the parents maintain that they have no plans to meddle with state elections or endorse any particular candidates. The group says they are in favor of removing guns from people who are danger to themselves or others, as well as strengthening firearm storage regulations and tightening background checks.\n",
      "So far, GOP lawmakers have overwhelmingly resisted calls made by Republican Gov. Bill Lee to pass legislation that would keep firearms away from people who could harm themselves or others. The Legislature initially rebuffed Lee's attempt to pass the legislation in the spring, forcing the governor to since declare that he'll call a special legislative session to take place in August for members to once again consider his proposal and others.\n",
      "Instead, the Republican supermajority has largely argued for the need to add more security to school buildings, and many have vowed to spike any proposals that would mimic so-called “red flag” laws that other states have passed in the wake of school shootings.\n",
      "Lee has maintained that his proposal is not a red flag law, which he describes as a “toxic political label.”\n",
      "To date, 19 states have red flag laws on the books — with many lawmakers enacting them after tragedies. Notably, Florida did so after the 2018 mass shooting at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland that killed 17 students. Law enforcement officials had received numerous complaints about the 19-year-old gunman’s threatening statements.\n",
      "Under Lee’s proposal, law enforcement would first determine if a person is a threat, then a hearing with the person in question would be held, generally within three to five days. A judge would rule whether they should indeed have their weapons taken away temporarily. If so, the person would have to surrender their guns and ammunition to a third party within two days and any handgun carry license would be suspended within three business days. The actions would last up to 180 days at a time.\n",

      "At this stage, it is difficult to predict their impact on Japanese equipment makers or Japan-China relations, but a group of Japanese politicians are already questioning the wisdom of Prime Minister Fumio Kishida’s seeming eagerness to side with the US in a trade war with China.\n",

      "In a broad sense, they do (through the use of semiconductors in weapons systems, computing and artificial intelligence), but so do other types of semiconductor production equipment that are not on the list.\n",
      "The vagueness appears to be deliberate, giving the government a free hand to grant or deny export licenses while supporting the US.\n",
      "In theory, equipment used at process nodes as large as 45 nanometers might be affected. In practice, the controls might be quite limited. Optimistic and pessimistic views of the restrictions compete, but their actual impact won’t be known until quarterly sales trends emerge and the companies involved provide commentary.\n",
      "In a worst-case scenario, the impact could be quite severe, putting billions of dollars’ worth of sales at risk and inviting retaliation in the form of Chinese restrictions on exports of critical materials such as gallium nitride, germanium and rare-earth metals.\n",
      "According to the International Trade Center of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Japan accounted for 30% of China’s imports of semiconductor production equipment in 2022. In the fiscal year ending March 2023, 23% of Tokyo Electron’s sales were made in China. Japan’s total trade with China in 2022 was 61% greater than its total trade with the US. There is a lot to lose.\n",
      "This has not escaped the attention of the Ishibashi Tanzan Study Group, a cross-party association of Diet members founded to discuss policies that promote Japan’s interests as a trading nation and do not simply follow those of the US.\n",
      "The group is led by Iwaya Takeshi, a former minister of defense from the ruling Liberal Democratic Party (LDP), Shinohara Takashi from the main opposition Constitutional Democratic Party, and Furukawa Motohisa from the Democratic Party for the People.\n",
      "Furukawa Yoshihisa, a former minister of justice from the LDP, serves as chief secretary. He was quoted by Toyo Keizai (The Oriental Economist) as saying, “Tanzan emphasized that ‘just following America is not good for either Japan or America. We will partner with America, but we will not subordinate ourselves to America.'”\n",
      "Group’s inspiration\n",
      "Ishibashi Tanzan was born in Tokyo in 1884. The son of a Buddhist priest named Sugita, he took his mother’s surname, Ishibashi, but later became a priest himself.\n",
      "After graduating from Waseda University, where he studied philosophy, he went to work as a journalist, first for the Mainichi newspaper and then for the Toyo Keizai magazine, rising to the positions of chief editor and, in 1941, president of the company. Waseda is one of the top two private universities in Japan.\n",
      "Ishibashi opposed Japanese militarism and colonialism and, after the war, the policies of the US occupation. He was appointed minister of finance by prime minister Yoshida Shigeru in May 1946. Elected to the Diet in April 1947, he was purged a month later for his independent views.\n",
      "After returning to politics in 1951, he supported the revision of Article 9 of the Japanese constitution, which renounces war as a sovereign right of the nation, and the rebuilding of Japan’s armed forces.\n",
      "Ishibashi was appointed minister of international trade and industry by prime minister Yukio Hatoyama in 1954 and succeeded him as prime minister in 1956. Forced to resign for health reasons after only two months in office, he remained in politics, visiting the People’s Republic of China in 1959 and opposing the revision of the US-Japan Security Treaty in 1960.\n",
      "The revised Security Treaty formalized the right of the US to maintain military bases in Japan in return for a commitment by the US to defend Japan from attack. It remains the cornerstone of US-Japan relations today.\n",
      "In China, Ishibashi met with premier Zhou Enlai. The joint communiqué they issued after the meeting stated:\n",
      "“Both sides believed that the peoples of China and Japan should hold hands and contribute to peace in [the] Far East and the world.… Mr Ishibashi stated that the Chinese and Japanese peoples should make efforts, based on their actual situations, for exchanges and developments in the political, economic and cultural spheres.\n",
      "“Premier Zhou concurred with his statement, and pointed out the development of political and economic relations between the two countries should be integrated rather than separated. Mr Ishibashi concurred with this.”\n",
      "Ishibashi died in 1973, but his ideas lived on as an alternative to the US-centric policies of successive LDP governments. They are enjoying a resurgence now due to concerns about the reliability of the US generated by former president Donald Trump, and the rise of protectionism and escalation of tensions with China under President Joe Biden.\n",
      "Even if there is no outward change in Kishida’s foreign policy, the Ishibashi Tanzan Study Group can be regarded as an exercise in contingency planning and a signal to China that Japan is not pursuing a single-minded policy – that is, risk hedging from the standpoint of a nation dependent on international trade as opposed to the “de-risking” now touted by the US, which interferes with that trade.\n",
      "In an opinion piece carried by the Nikkei newspaper under a pseudonym this month, the author wrote that the link between the formation of economic blocs and war is one of the lessons of history and that if Japan is to live as a trading nation, it should not worry about choosing between the US and China but be more focused on taking the market.\n",

Regrettably, Healy did not honor these assurances, despite our trust in their commitment. Healy’s actions took us by complete surprise, and we halted the show as promptly as feasible following the incident,” organizers added in a separate statement.\n",
      "“Healy’s unprofessional behavior and overt defiance of Malaysian laws and regulations are disturbing. Healy chose to utilize his performance as a platform to express his personal views, rather than delivering the quality show that his Malaysian fans were eagerly anticipating. This act is deeply unfair to his fans who were looking forward to enjoying a memorable music experience.”\n",
      "On Friday, Healy apologized to fans for accepting Good Vibes’ invitation to play, saying he was unaware of Malaysia’s hardline stance toward the LGBTQ community; same-sex relationships are outlawed in the country and punishable by prison time and caning.\n",
      "“I made a mistake. When we were booking shows, I wasn’t looking into it,” Healy said. “I don’t see the fucking point, right, I do not see the point of inviting the 1975 to a country and then telling us who we can have sex with.”\n",
      "Healy continued, “I am sorry if that offends you and you’re religious and it’s part of your fucking government, but your government are a bunch of fucking retards and I don’t care anymore. If you push, I am going to push back. I am not in the fucking mood.”\n",
      "Healy then told the crowd that the band had previously played a gig in an LGBTQ-unfriendly country — “I don’t know what the fuck it is,” Healy said; it was Dubai in 2019, where Healy kissed a male fan onstage to protest the laws — and, upon concluding his speech, kissed the 1975 bassist Ross McDonald.\n",
      "Following the show’s seventh song, “I Couldn’t Be More in Love,” the gig was abruptly cut short, with Healy telling the crowd they “just got banned from Kuala Lumpur.”\n",

      "WASHINGTON (AP) — New rules for the nation’s oil and gas leasing program would raise costs for energy companies to drill on public lands and strengthen requirements for cleaning up old wells where drilling is completed or abandoned, the Biden administration said Thursday.\n",
      "A rule proposed by the Interior Department raises royalty rates for oil drilling by more than one-third, to 16.67 percent, in accordance with the sweeping climate law approved by Congress last year. The previous rate of 12.5 percent paid by oil and gas companies for federal drilling rights had remained unchanged for a century. The federal rate was significantly lower than what many states and private landowners charge for drilling leases on state or private lands.\n",
      "The new rule does not go so far as to prohibit new oil and gas leasing on public lands, as many environmental groups have urged and as President Joe Biden promised during the 2020 campaign. But officials said the proposal would lead to a more responsible leasing process that provides a better return to U.S. taxpayers.\n",
      "The plan codifies provisions in the climate law, known as the Inflation Reduction Act, as well as the 2021 infrastructure law and recommendations from an Interior report on oil and gas leasing issued in November 2021.\n",
      "The new rule “provides a fair return to taxpayers, adequately accounts for environmental harms and discourages speculation by oil and gas companies,” said Laura Daniel-Davis, principal deputy assistant Interior secretary for land and minerals management.\n",
      "Interior “is committed to creating a more transparent, inclusive and just approach to leasing and permitting that serves the public interest while protecting natural and cultural resources on our public lands,″ she added.\n",

      "The new royalty rate set by the climate law is expected to remain in place until August 2032, after which it can be increased.\n",
      "The rule also would increase the minimum leasing bond paid by energy companies to $150,000, up from the previous $10,000 established in 1960. The higher bonding requirement is intended to ensure that companies meet their obligations to clean up drilling sites after they are done or cap wells that are abandoned.\n",
      "The previous level was far too low to force companies to act and did not cover potential costs to reclaim a well, officials said. As a result, taxpayers frequently end up covering cleanup costs for abandoned or depleted wells if an operator refuses to do so or declares bankruptcy. Hundreds of thousands of “orphaned” oil and gas wells and abandoned coal and hardrock mines pose serious safety hazards, while causing ongoing environmental damage.\n",
      "The Interior Department has made available more than $1 billion in the past two years from the infrastructure law to clean up orphaned oil and gas wells on public lands. The new rule aims to prevent that burden from falling on taxpayers in the future.\n",
      "Bureau of Land Management Director Tracy Stone-Manning, whose agency issued the new rule, said the proposal “aims to ensure fairness to the taxpayer and balanced, responsible development as we continue to transition to a clean energy economy. It includes common-sense and needed fiscal revisions to BLM’s program, many directed by Congress.”\n",
      "The BLM, an Interior Department agency, oversees more than 245 million acres of public lands, primarily in the West.\n",
      "Environmental groups hailed the rule change as overdue and said the Biden administration recognized that business as usual by the oil and gas industry is incompatible with increased risks from climate change — a crisis the oil industry played a large role in creating.\n",
      "WATCH: Biden’s complex relationship with oil and gas, despite campaign promises\n",
      "“These changes were badly needed — to put it mildly — and will help make onshore leasing more fair to taxpayers and hold industry accountable for its harms,” said Josh Axelrod of the Natural Resources Defense Council.\n",
      "But he and other advocates said Biden should keep his promise to end new drilling on public lands. “In addition to making polluters pay with these fiscal reforms, it’s time for the Biden administration to align our federal fossil fuel program with America’s transition to a clean energy economy,” said Mattea Mrkusic of Evergreen Action, another environmental group.\n",
      "The oil industry said the rule change would discourage oil and gas production in the United States.\n",
      "“Responsible development of federal lands is critical for meeting the growing demand for affordable, reliable energy while reducing (greenhouse gas) emissions,” said Holly Hopkins, vice president of the American Petroleum Institute, an industry lobbying group.\n",
      "“Amidst a global energy crisis, this action from the Department of the Interior is yet another attempt to add even more barriers to future energy production,” she said.\n",
      "The proposal issued Thursday follows an Interior report on federal oil and gas leasing issued in November 2021. Biden ordered the report soon after taking office in January 2021 as he directed a pause in federal oil and gas lease sales, citing worries about climate change.\n",
      "The moratorium drew sharp criticism from congressional Republicans and the oil industry, even as many environmentalists and Democrats urged Biden to make the leasing pause permanent.\n",
      "The moratorium was overturned by the courts, and oil and gas lease sales have resumed, including some mandated by the climate law in a compromise with Democratic Sen. Joe Manchin of West Virginia.\n",
      "A separate proposal by the Biden administration would put conservation on equal footing with industry. The plan would allow conservationists and others to lease federally owned land to restore it, much the same way oil companies buy leases to drill and ranchers pay to graze cattle. Leases also could be bought on behalf of companies such as oil drillers who want to offset damage to public land by restoring acreage elsewhere.\n",
      "Critics including Republican lawmakers and agriculture industry representatives blast the BLM plan as a way to exclude mining, energy development and agriculture.\n",

      "Original Article : Last week, Donald Trump let loose with one of his tantrums disguised as a fundraising appeal on Truth Social, this time claiming that special prosecutor Jack Smith had sent him a letter indicating he's the target of a Justice Department investigation, this time related to Trump's attempted coup that resulted in the insurrection on January 6, 2021. Such letters are often preliminary to indictments. Most legal experts say it's a near-certainty in this case. Recent reporting suggests that Trump will likely face indictments for conspiracy to defraud the government and obstruction of an official proceeding. He may also be charged with conspiracy to deny people their civil rights, utilizing a law first passed to empower federal authorities to deal with the Klu Klux Klan.\n",
      "Considering that his last round of indictments involved the Espionage Act, it's wild that these potential indictments are even more serious. Most experts believe Smith wouldn't do this if he didn't have the evidence for a conviction, and the possible charges are serious enough to put Trump away for the rest of his life. As the hearings of the House Select Committee on the January 6 attack showed, there's substantial evidence Trump knowingly led a conspiracy, and no doubt the grand jury investigation Smith is leading uncovered more. All of which suggests Trump's regular meltdowns on social media aren't just fundraising gambits, but sincere displays of panic from a man who has no doubt been long worried if all his criming would eventually catch up to him.\n",
      "We need your help to stay independent\n",
      "Trump isn't just whining in his usual all-caps style, however. He's also escalating his violent threats, in an impotent bid to scare federal prosecutors into backing down. On Tuesday, Trump gave an interview on an Iowa-based talk show where, mob-style, he issued a \"warning\" that was actually a threat. When asked about the possibility of going to jail, the former president said, \"I think it's a very dangerous thing to even talk about, because we do have a tremendously passionate group of voters, much more passion than they had in 2020 and much more passion than they had in 2016.\"\n",
      "Then on Thursday, Trump posted a video on his Truth Social account that was even less subtle. In it, ominous music plays over a shot of Trump's eyes glaring, as his voiceover says, \"If you f**k around with us, if you do something bad to us, we are going to do things to you that have never been done before.\"\n",
      "On Sunday, he went hard on Truth Social, winding up his supporters with unsubtly violent language. \"IT WILL ONLY GET WORSE. WE MUST STOP THESE \"MONSTERS\" FROM FURTHER DESTROYING OUR COUNTRY!\" he raved in one post. He also repeatedly reposted threatening memes sent by his often QAnon-drunk followers.\n",
      "This is part of a larger pattern of Trump trying, with intermittent success, to replicate the events of January 6 by inciting his followers to violence. He posted photos suggesting he'd like to beat District Attorney Alvin Bragg, who is prosecuting him for fraud in New York, with a baseball bat. He implicitly celebrated the 30th anniversary of the Branch Davidians' self-immolation in Waco, TX, with a rally that also valorized the January 6 riot. He posted former president Barack Obama's address, which led to a follower allegedly trying to assassinate Obama. He shared information about prosecutors' families, another obvious threat. He posted threatening rhetoric after the feds searched Mar-a-Lago for missing classified documents, which led to one follower dying in an attack on an FBI office.\n",
      "Being bad at terrorism is no defense, especially for someone who keeps trying to instigate political violence.\n",
      "Trump loves hiding behind his security guards while telling his idiot followers to commit acts of violence for him. He does it more often than most people eat breakfast. This is why legal experts so often pity Trump's defense lawyers, even though they are making a fortune off his campaign donors. This stuff isn't just dangerous and a bad look. It also nukes what was Trump's strongest defense in any January 6 case. No longer can he argue that he wasn't trying to kick off a riot when he told his followers to \"march\" on the Capitol, and they just did that on their own. Instead, Trump is handing prosecutors a pattern of behavior they can point to.\n",
      "Want more Amanda Marcotte on politics? Subscribe to her newsletter Standing Room Only.\n",
      "Trump's repeated efforts to make another January 6 happen don't just make it harder to argue his innocence in a court of law. It also makes a lot harder for Republicans who, foolishly, are still trying to defend Trump in the court of public opinion. Speaker of the House Kevin McCarthy, R-Calif., squealed that this is only happening because \"Trump went up in the polls.\" This is the same McCarthy who, in the immediate aftermath of the insurrection, correctly stated that Trump \"bears responsibility for Wednesday's attack on Congress by mob rioters.\" Other Republicans followed suit in pretending this is all ridiculous. House Minority Leader Steve Scalise, R-La., for instance, complained about a \"double standard.\"\n",
      "These kinds of B.S. defenses depend on pretending that Trump didn't attempt a coup or incite an insurrection as if it was all just some weird coincidence. Gov. Ron DeSantis, R-Fla., offered a good example of how silly this gets, lamely saying on CNN that Trump \"should have come out more forcefully\" in telling rioters to go home on January 6. The clear implication is that the rioters were just acting on their own accord and Trump's only sin was in moving too slowly in response. In reality, Trump sent those rioters to the Capitol as part of a larger plot to block President Joe Biden's election certification so that a group of fake electors — some of whom are facing charges of their own — could come in and steal the election for him. The \"Trump didn't want that riot\" play is stupid on its face but becomes even more so every time Trump makes another threat.\n",
      "Unsubtly begging his followers to use violence to block a legal proceeding is the standard operating procedure for Trump. Sure, it doesn't work most of the time. Mostly, his followers ignore his repeated entreaties that they go to prison in an ineffective bid to keep him out of it. Even when he can get his followers to act out violently, they've so far not achieved their goals, thankfully. Trump keeps returning to the well of violent threats because he's mean and not very bright, so can't accept that his favorite move just isn't working for him. But being bad at terrorism is no defense, especially for someone who keeps trying to instigate political violence.\n",
      "\"Stop saying I'm violent or I'll send people to murder your family\" is an unpersuasive argument, of course. That Trump keeps going there, however, is a sign he is as desperate as he is stupid. He knows that he can't win the case on the merits, so his efforts are focused on trying to stop any case from going forward. The good news is that Smith is not going to be intimidated. The man has prosecuted violent gang members and war criminals. A coward like Trump is not going to rattle the nerves of the special prosecutor who has taken him on so forcefully.\n",

      "Earlier in the day, the White House announced the first offshore wind lease sale in the Gulf of Mexico, which it says will have enough clean energy potential to power nearly 1.3 million homes.\n",
      "“When I think climate, I think jobs,” Biden said. “I think union jobs. Not a joke.”\n",
      "Biden visited the Philly Shipyard after a steel-cutting ceremony earlier in the day to mark the construction of an offshore wind vessel.\n",
      "The power generators will bring an estimated $125 million in economic activity every year, and 1,000 workers across nine unions have been employed to build them, using steel plates made by the United Steelworkers in Indiana, the White House said.\n",
      "Biden said: \"All this investment means good-paying jobs here at home, here at home. We're making sure these new jobs come free and fair and the ability to join a union if you're not already in one.\"\n",
      "The potential for more strikes looms over Biden's re-election campaign.\n",
      "On Wednesday, Biden met briefly with Shawn Fain, the president of the United Auto Workers union, a White House official said. UAW leaders had asked to brief senior White House staff members about their analysis and positions in relation to negotiations with the Big Three automakers — General Motors, Ford and Stellantis. Fain has said the UAW is willing to strike against those companies.\n",
      "UPS workers have also threatened to strike as Teamsters leaders, who represent UPS workers, negotiate a new labor contract. Meanwhile, the national board of the Screen Actors Guild-American Federation of Television and Radio Artists, also known as SAG-AFTRA, voted unanimously to go on strike this month after the Writers Guild of America had already gone on strike.\n",
      "Biden has frequently referred to himself as the most pro-union president in history. \"I made a commitment that I'd be the most pro-union president in American history, and I'm keeping that promise,\" he said Thursday.\n",
      "Despite his administration's efforts to promote his \"Bidenomics\" agenda, his economic approval rating has risen only slightly, by 3 percentage points, to 37% in April, according to CNBC’s new All-America Economic Survey.\n",
      "This summer, high-level administration officials spread out over the country to tout Biden's economic agenda as part of the Investing in America tour. Biden highlighted the importance of infrastructure in a speech about Bidenomics in South Carolina on July 6.\n",
      "Bidenomics focuses on three points: making public investments, educating workers to grow the middle class and promoting competition, according to the White House.\n",
      "Across the aisle, the GOP has seized upon voters' worries over the economy to attack Bidenomics. The White House took a swipe at Republicans in Congress in its fact sheet announcing Biden's visit to Philadelphia, saying that if Republicans \"had their way, their states would have lost out on billions of dollars in investments, jobs, and opportunity.\"\n",
      "\"Yet nearly every Republican Member of the House voted again to overturn the Inflation Reduction Act’s clean energy tax credits in April 2023 — doubling down on their opposition at a time when manufacturers were investing in their state,\" the White House wrote.\n",
      "In a statement in 2021 explaining his vote, Tuberville said he would be \"for a bill that invests every penny of every dollar in improvements to our roads, bridges, waterways, and rural broadband,\" but he added that \"the final legislation is loaded with giveaways to big cities and pet projects that have little to do with real infrastructure.\"\n",
      "Biden said: \"Here’s what he says now: 'Great to see Alabama receive critical funds to boost ongoing broadband efforts.' Thought he thought it was a bad idea to invest in that, but now it’s coming to Alabama, and hot damn, boys, good thing.\"\n",
      "Biden also condemned Tuberville's blockade of hundreds of military promotions as a move that jeopardizes \"our national security.\"\n",
      "\"I’m glad the senator’s coming around on the infrastructure law, but I’m not going to let up until he comes around in the critical military nominations, as well,\" Biden said.\n",

The American flag will be raised to mark the U.S. return to membership after a five-year absence.\n",

      "In a statement, UNESCO noted that Odesa’s historic center was declared a UNESCO World Heritage site earlier this year and said attacks by Russian forces contradict recent promises by Russian authorities to take precautions to spare such sites across the country.\n",
      "Before returning to Washington on Wednesday, Biden will tour a historic venue in France, Mont-Saint-Michel, a 1,000-year-old Benedictine abbey that was listed as a World Heritage site in 1979. It sits on an island in Normandy, in the north of the country.\n",

      "The band’s performance was cut short on Friday, the first day of the three-day Good Vibes Festival, after frontman Matty Healy gave a speech criticising the Malaysian government for criminalising same-sex relationships.\n",
      "“I made a mistake when we were booking shows, I wasn’t looking into it. I don’t see the ****ing point, right? I do not see the point of inviting The 1975 to a country and telling us who we can have sex with,” Healy told the crowd.\n",
      "“And I’m sorry if that offends you and you’re religious... If you push, I’m gonna push back.”\n",
      "Homosexuality is forbidden in Malaysia, and laws criminalising sodomy can result in imprisonment or corporal punishment.\n",

      "“And that’s not fair on you, because you’re not representative of your government. You are young people, and I’m sure a lot of you are gay and progressive,” he said.\n",

      "Malaysians have left disparaging comments on The 1975’s social media pages, voicing their disappointment at the band and lead vocalist Healy for being disrespectful towards the country’s customs, and their “surface-level activism”.\n",
      "One fan, Ms Yasmin Devan, blamed the band for being “the reason the festival got cancelled after just one day” and possibly for the wider repercussions.\n",

      "Popular American YouTube musician David Choi also weighed in, saying it was a shame that The 1975’s “extremely selfish, unprofessional, and most of all, privileged actions... probably made things worse for the progressives in a mostly Islamic country”.\n",

      "Details: Data from the analytical website Oryx, which only takes into account the loss of equipment with video or photo evidence of damage, indicates that several dozen more machines have been damaged to varying degrees. Many of them have been repaired and returned to the battlefield. Some of them have to be sent to Poland for more serious repairs.\n",

      "At the same time, the same source states that there were \"anecdotal reports to the contrary\". In his opinion, in some cases, Ukrainians are \"just not using them [the vehicles – ed.] to their fullest potential with all their other assets that they have available\".\n",

      "The survey was commissioned by children’s charity Plan International Germany. Its findings were published in regional newspaper Westdeutsche Allgemeine Zeitung.\n",
      "A group of 1,000 men and 1,000 women aged 18-35 from across Germany were asked to give their views on masculinity for the study, which was carried out online.\n",
      "34% of men from that age bracket admitted to being violent towards their female partner in the past, to “instil respect in them.” 33% said they thought it was acceptable if their “hand slipped” occasionally during an argument with their partner.\n",
      "Exploring attitudes to victim-blaming and double standards, the survey found that 50% of men said they would not want a relationship with a woman who had had many sexual partners, while 20% of the women interviewed agreed with this statement.\n",
      "The survey also found that expectations within a relationship differed greatly between men and women.\n",
      "Just over half of men – 52% – wanted a relationship in the form of a “breadwinner-housewife model,” where they earned most of the money for the household and childcare and household tasks were primarily the woman’s role.\n",

      "Original Article : NEW DELHI (AP) - Thousands of people, mostly women, held a massive sit-in in India's violence-wracked northeastern state of Manipur on Saturday to demand the immediate arrest of anyone who took part in the harrowing May assault of two women who were paraded around naked and molested by a mob in an attack that was caught on video.\n",
      "The leaders of religious and women's groups addressed the nearly 15,000 protesters, who also called for the firing of Biren Singh, the top elected official in the state where more than 130 people have been killed since violence between two dominant ethnic groups erupted in early May. The protest was held in Churachandpur, a town 65 kilometers (40 miles) south of Imphal, the state capital.\n",
      "Manipur has been the scene of a near-civil war that was sparked by Christian Kukis protesting against a demand by the mostly Hindu Meiteis for a special status that would let them buy land in the hills populated by Kukis and other tribal groups, as well as a guaranteed share of government jobs.\n",
      "A video showing the women being assaulted triggered widespread outrage and was widely shared on social media late Wednesday despite the government largely blocking the internet and keeping journalists out of the remote state. The footage shows the two naked women surrounded by scores of young men who grope their genitals and drag them to a field.\n",
      "The women are from the Kuki-Zo community, according to the Indigenous Tribal Leaders' Forum, a tribal organization in Manipur. One of them told The Associated Press that the men who assaulted them were part of a Meitei mob that had earlier torched their village.\n",
      "“They forced us to remove our clothes and said we will be killed if we don't do as told. Then they made us walk naked. They abused us. They touched us everywhere â€¦ on our breasts, our genitals,” she said by phone from Manipur.\n",
      "The woman said the duo was then led into a field where they were both sexually assaulted. The two women are now safe in a refugee camp.\n",
      "Police said the assault occurred May 4, a day after the violence between the Kukis and Meiteis started. According to a police complaint filed on May 18, the mob attacked the family of the two women and killed its two male members. The complaint alleges rape and murder by “unknown miscreants.”\n",
      "The emergence and widespread sharing of the video led India's prime minister, Narendra Modi, to break his more than two months of public silence over the ethnic clashes in Manipur, saying Thursday that the attack on the women was unforgivable.\n",
      "The Manipur state government on Saturday announced a fifth arrest in the attack. Rajiv Singh, the state's director-general of police, said officers were carrying out raids to arrest other suspects.\n",
      "The deadly clashes have persisted despite the army's presence in Manipur, a state of 3.2 million people tucked in the mountains on India's border with Myanmar that is now divided into two ethnic zones. More than 60,000 people have fled to packed relief camps.\n",
      "Nearly 400 men and women also held a protest in the Indian capital with similar demands. They carried placards reading “We demand action against the perpetrators” and ”Resign, Biren Singh.”\n",
      "In Manipur state, the protesters assembled at a “Wall of Remembrance” site in an open ground in Churachandpur, a stronghold of the Kuki tribe, where they kept dummy coffins of people from their minority community who have been killed in the violence.\n",
      "Ngaineikim, the chairperson of the Kuki Women's Organization for Human Rights, accused Singh, who belongs to the majority Meiti community, of orchestrating atrocities and then expressing sympathy for the victims.\n",
      "Singh did not immediately comment on the calls to resign, but on Thursday, he said an investigation was underway to ensure “strict action is taken against all the perpetrators, including considering the possibility of capital punishment. Let it be known, there is absolutely no place for such heinous acts in our society.”\n",

      "Jamaica made history Sunday by picking up their first point in a Women's World Cup -- after three defeats in their 2019 debut -- as they put up a great fight against France to frustrate them 0-0 in Sydney.\n",
      "However, the sending-off of captain and best player Khadija \"Bunny\" Shaw right at the end of the game for a harsh second yellow card will sour the celebrations a bit for the Reggae Girlz. The Manchester City striker, who led by example against Les Bleues by causing them all sort of problems in the first half, will miss the next game against Panama on Saturday, but will be back for the potentially decisive clash with Brazil on Aug. 2.\n",
      "Shaw, like the rest of Lorne Donaldson's squad, put in a lot of intensity and physicality in the first half to disturb France's rhythm and forced them to make errors with sloppy passing. It was a spirited performance from Jamaica and they will draw a lot of confidence from the game as they bid to do better against Brazil than the 3-0 defeat they managed four years ago.\n",
      "For new France head coach Hervé Renard, it was not the debut he wanted. For his second World Cup of the season (after managing Saudi Arabia at the men's one in Qatar), he got his tactics wrong with a wonky 4-4-2 to start the game and the choice of Amel Majri over Kenza Dali, who had been Les Bleues' best player in their friendly matches before the competition.\n",
      "Dali made a huge difference when she came on after 66 minutes. France created enough chances to score, but Kadidiatou Diani hitting the bar and the post with the same header right at the end of the game perfectly summed up their frustrating evening. Now the game against Brazil on Saturday will be huge for Renard and his players.\n",

When asked if she was frustrated to begin among the replacements, Daly said: \"I think anyone would be. No one is happy to sit on the bench. If you are, then you are not in the right place, not in the right career. It's a tough place for Sarina [Wiegman] to be, to pick the team.

      "WELLINGTON, New Zealand -- Sweden were made to toil in the Wellington wind and rain before breaking South African hearts in the final minute in the first World Cup match to feature goals for both teams.\n",
      "South Africa sit 51 places behind Sweden, who are ranked third, in FIFA's world rankings but that difference was not on show here. While Sweden enjoyed most of the possession, the African champions were dangerous on the break.\n",
      "The electric Thembi Kgatlana posed the biggest threat and it was her deflected shot which created a tap in for Hildah Magaia, who injured herself bundling the ball into the net in the 48th minute. It was only South Africa's second-ever goal at a World Cup, which was a good reason for the bench to charge into the corner of the pitch to celebrate.\n",
      "However, they were not able to celebrate their first win at a finals -- or even a first point. Fridolina Rolfo pulled Sweden level in a slightly fortunate manner, turning home a cross with a touch she knew little about. And as the Sweden corner count racked up late on, reaching 13, the pressure eventually paid off when Amanda Ilestedt nodded home in the 90th minute. -- Sam Marsden.\n",
      "Lawson: A game of football that matched the weather Sophie Lawson reports from Netherlands' 1-0 win over Portugal in a wet and windy Dunedin evening.\n",
      "Netherlands do enough\n",
      "DUNEDIN, New Zealand -- At the 2019 World Cup, Netherlands threatened to move through the gears yet never quite found top speed. They did, however, do enough in first gear to reach the final, but their team has drastically changed since then. As has the global landscape of women's football. Now, if you want to go far in a tournament, it's not enough merely threaten a bit without delivering on that threat.\n",
      "Against Portugal, a team making their World Cup debut, the Dutch did enough and little more than that. The veterans in the team who had not just been there and done it, but had picked up silverware as well, mostly provided the brighter moments. But they would still need to go back to the playbook to break the deadlock.\n",
      "Reminiscent of a goal scored against Portugal at the Euros last year, Stefanie van der Gragt nodded home in the first half to decide the tie. Portugal improved as the match went on but struggled to harness their attacking threats, barely able to get into the Dutch box or test goalkeeper Daphne van Domselaar.\n",
      "The match was a damp squib to match the dreary weather in Dunedin, with neither team looking overly prepared to deal with the world champions -- Sophie Lawson.\n",
      "Will Germany prove to be contenders?\n",
      "DUNEDIN, New Zealand -- Coming into this World Cup, Germany were once again rated among the favourites (next to the U.S., France, etc.) and although they have their flaws, they're still hopeful of lifting the trophy on Aug. 20 ... something they haven't managed since 2007.\n",
      "It would be easy to dismiss the buzz around Germany by looking at their recent history, but there is something more to this team. A strong domestic league and firmly defined pathways for players to graduate through the youth ranks and move into the senior team provides the foundations for Germany's longevity.\n",
      "Although nowhere near able to rival the U.S. for sheer depth of registered girls and women playing football, Germany nevertheless continues to bring through talented generation after talented generation, which is what keeps them in the conversation at youth tournaments (with the likes of Japan and Spain).\n",
      "The story heading into this World Cup is a familiar one: after fizzling out in 2019 and falling just short at last summer's Euros, Germany looked unconvincing in warm-up games. There has been a lack of cohesion in the side and the attackers that coach Martina Voss-Tecklenburg has called upon often look rushed and struggle with the basics. However, there's an expectation that the pieces will magically fall into place once the ball gets rolling against Morocco in Melbourne. -- Sophie Lawson.\n",
      "Morocco look to inspire\n",
      "MELBOURNE/NAARM, Australia -- In an appealing piece of synchronicity, Morocco's first-ever appearance at the Women's World Cup comes against Germany on Monday evening, mirroring the debut of its men's side on football's biggest stage at Mexico 1970. Then, a squad featuring just 19 players and led by Yugoslavian coach Blagoje Vidinic, played their first men's World Cup game against West Germany, going down 2-1.\n",
      "Now 53 years on, the Atlas Lionesses' status as the first-ever Arab nation to qualify for a WWC ensures their place in history regardless of what happens in the coming weeks, but their opening game against the two-time world champions has the potential to set the tone for the rest of the tournament.\n",
      "Expecting Reynald Pedros' side to upset the Germans is an unrealistic proposition, but the likely absence of Marina Hegering and Lena Oberdorf as well as Germany's problems with defending transition in warm-up fixtures against Vietnam and Zambia could augur opportunities for the likes of Rosella Ayane, Fatima Tagnaout and Sakina Ouzraoui on the counter.\n",

Argentina has never advanced out of the group stage in a Women's World Cup while Italy reached the quarterfinals in the previous edition in 2019. And Oddsmakers have also picked Italy to win with their betting lines.\n",
      "If form matters though, Argentina clearly has the edge. They've seemingly found their footing under manager German Portanova and they will be entering this tournament with plenty of confidence, going without a loss in six games in 2023. If Argentina has a vulnerability, it's their leaky defense but fortunately for them, Italy is a team that lacks firepower.\n",
      "Midfielder Manuela Giugliano is a special player but Le Azzurre lack a clinical finisher ahead of her. After crashing out in the group stage of last summer's Euros, the Italians are still stumbling. Their losses to England (ranked No. 4) and Belgium (No. 19) earlier this year showed an Italy that is not ready to take on top teams. But a draw to 72nd-ranked Morocco earlier this month suggests Italy might not be ready for any of the other teams in their group, Argentina included. -- Caitlin Murray.\n",

      "Established powers such as Sweden, England, United States and host nation Australia have all been challenged by less-heralded opposition in their opening matches, while Norway fell to an upset against an emotionally-charged New Zealand.\n",

Coach Pia Sundhage has garnered a reputation as someone who likes to chop and change her starting XI, but it'll be fascinating to see who gets the nod up front for the Selecao when they face Panama on Monday.\n",
      "Debinha should start, but who will Sundhage pair with her? Will she go with the in-form Geyse, or go for someone a little different with Bia Zaneratto? Marta, 37, is unlikely to feature against Panama as she continues her comeback from a hamstring injury, but her presence will still be indispensable to this group as they start to prepare for life after the legend as she embarks in her final World Cup.

      "Minor party candidates and independents fared even worse, but for many, Laurence Fox’s continued electoral failure was the main talking point.\n",
      "The actor-turned-politician won just 2.31 per cent of the vote, meaning he will now lose the deposit he paid to run in the first place. Candidates must win five per cent of the vote share to retain their deposits.\n",
      "Fox previously lost his £10,000 deposit in the 2021 London mayoral election, where he pledged to “fight against extreme political correctness” and “end the Met’s obsession with diversity and inclusivity”. He was endorsed by Reform UK and Nigel Farage, but finished in sixth place, behind YouTuber Niko Omilana. Fox received only 1.9 per cent of the vote.\n",

      "Original Article : DENVER -- A Colorado deputy who deployed a Taser on a man who was then hit and killed by an SUV on Interstate 25 won’t face criminal charges, prosecutors said Friday.\n",
      "While Larimer County Deputy Lorenzo Lujan's decision to use the Taser on Brent Thompson after he ran away as the deputy tried to arrest him showed “poor judgment” and possibly the need for more training, 8th District Attorney Gordon McLaughlin said it was not likely a jury would find Lujan criminally negligent and convict him.\n",
      "According to McLaughlin's letter summarizing the investigation into Thompson's death, Thompson pulled off at an I-25 exit after Lujan turned on his patrol car's lights at night on Feb. 18. But as Lujan tried to arrest Thompson, who allegedly gave a false name and did not have a driver's license, he ran down an embankment toward the highway.\n",
      "Body camera footage showed Thompson was getting onto the interstate from the shoulder when Lujan deployed the Taser, and another officer said he saw Thompson fall in the northbound side of the roadway, the summarizing letter said. The second officer then saw approaching headlights and waved his flashlight to warn that vehicle to stop.\n",
      "The man driving the Ford Explorer, with his wife and three children inside, said he saw something in the road and two people standing along the highway. He said he tried to steer away from the people and hit something in the road.\n",
      "Lujan, who was working overtime, told investigators he wanted to detain Thompson so he did not pose a threat to himself or drivers on the interstate.\n",
      "However, the letter noted that he looked for approaching vehicles about 20 seconds before deploying the Taser, but not right before using it about 15 seconds later, calling that “a clear lapse in judgement.”\n",
      "A law firm representing Thompson's family, Rathod Mohamedbhai LLC, called the decision not to pursue charges a “travesty of justice\" and called for Lujan to be fired.\n",
      "Lujan has been working in a non-enforcement capacity since early July and will remain in that role until the conclusion of the department's own investigation into what happened, sheriff's office spokesperson Kate Kimble said. It is expected to wrap up in the next few days, she said.\n",
      "Such internal investigations typically look at whether department policies were followed.\n",

      "“As unconscionable as it is locking a person in a police car on railroad tracks, it is even more unconscionable to tase someone on the interstate at night. Tasing a person on the interstate is a death sentence,” it said.\n",
      "One of the lawyers representing Thompson’s family, Siddhartha Rathod, who has seen the body camera footage, said Thompson was in the middle of the northbound lanes when he was hit with the Taser. Lujan was a few feet away and had to get back to avoid being hit himself, he said.\n",

      "Original Article : SAN JUAN, Puerto Rico -- Attorneys for the widow of slain Haitian President Jovenel Moïse filed a lawsuit Thursday in Florida against those accused in his assassination, which is still under investigation.\n",
      "The lawsuit, which was first shared with The Associated Press, seeks unspecified damages for Moïse’s family and a trial by jury in a push to hold the defendants responsible for the president’s death.\n",
      "“Whatever assets are out there, we will make sure these people will pay,” attorney Paul Turner told the AP.\n",
      "The lawsuit was filed nearly two years after the July 7, 2021 assassination of Moïse, who was shot a dozen times at his private home in an attack that also seriously injured his wife, Martine Moïse. More than 40 people have been arrested in the case, including a former Haitian senator, an ex-government official who worked at an anti-corruption agency and 18 former soldiers from Colombia.\n",
      "Turner said he believes there are more people involved in the presidential assassination who have not been identified.\n",
      "“We believe there are deep pockets or political power behind this,” he said.\n",
      "Eleven suspects are being held in U.S. federal prison as Turner lamented that the case is languishing in Haiti, where four judges appointed to oversee the investigation have been dismissed or resigned for personal reasons.\n",
      "One judge previously told the AP that his family asked him not to take the case because they feared he would be killed. Another judge stepped down after one of his assistants died under murky circumstances.\n",
      "Turner noted that while the U.S. government has kept him and Moïse’s family abreast of developments in the case, the Haitian government has not shared any information with them, including the inventory of personal assets that belonged to Moïse and his family that local authorities seized after he was killed.\n",
      "“We would like to see more transparency,” he said.\n",
      "A spokesperson for Haiti’s Justice Ministry did not respond to a message seeking comment.\n",
      "The lawsuit filed at a Miami circuit court accuses some of the suspects of causing the president’s death and serious injury to his wife, Martine Moïse, who was shot multiple times.\n",
      "It also alleges 11 other counts including battery, assault, civil conspiracy and intentional infliction of emotional distress, stating that “defendants engaged in extreme and outrageous conduct in conspiring to torture and assassinate President Moise.\n",
      "“The implausible goal — upon assassinating President Moise in cold blood — was for the co-conspirators to install their own kangaroo government which would then summarily pardon the assassins. Setting aside the sheer insanity of their end game, the assassins succeeded in part,” the lawsuit stated.\n",
      "Eleven of the 12 people named in the suit remain in U.S. federal prison, except for one who is under house arrest.\n",

      "TALLINN, Estonia (AP) — Russian prosecutors have asked a court to sentence imprisoned opposition leader Alexei Navalny to 20 years in prison on extremism charges, his ally Ivan Zhdanov said Thursday.\n",
      "According to Zhdanov, the trial against Navalny, which has been held behind closed doors in the prison where the politician is serving another lengthy sentence, is scheduled to conclude with a verdict on Aug. 4. If the court finds Navalny guilty, it will be his fifth criminal conviction, all of which have been widely seen as a deliberate strategy by the Kremlin to silence its ardent opponent.\n",
      "In his closing statement released Thursday by his team, Navalny bashed Russian authorities as being governed by “bargaining, power, bribery, deception, treachery … and not law.” Navalny said: “Anyone in Russia knows that a person who seeks justice in a court of law is completely vulnerable. The case of that person is hopeless.”\n",
      "WATCH: Why Navalny poses a special challenge to Putin’s leadership\n",
      "Navalny, 47, is President Vladimir Putin’s fiercest foe who exposed official corruption and organized major anti-Kremlin protests. He was arrested in January 2021 upon returning to Moscow after recuperating in Germany from nerve agent poisoning that he blamed on the Kremlin.\n",
      "The authorities sentenced him to 2 1/2 years in prison for parole violations and then to another nine years on charges of fraud and contempt of court.\n",
      "The politician is currently serving his sentence in a maximum-security prison east of Moscow. He has spent months in a tiny one-person cell, also called a “punishment cell,” for purported disciplinary violations such as an alleged failure to properly button his prison clothes, properly introduce himself to a guard or to wash his face at a specified time.\n",
      "Navalny’s allies have accused prison authorities of failing to provide him with proper medical assistance and voiced concern about his health.\n",
      "The new charges relate to the activities of Navalny’s anti-corruption foundation and statements by his top associates. His allies said the charges retroactively criminalize all the foundation’s activities since its creation in 2011.\n",
      "Navalny has rejected all the charges against him as politically motivated and has accused the Kremlin of seeking to keep him behind bars for life.\n",
      "One of his associates — Daniel Kholodny — was relocated from a different prison to face trial alongside him. The prosecution has asked to sentence Kholodny to 10 years in prison.\n",
      "The trial against the two began a month ago and went along swiftly by Russian standards, where people often spend months, if not years, awaiting for their verdict. It was unusually shielded from public attention and Navalny’s lawyers haven’t offered any comments on the proceedings.\n",
      "Navalny, in his sardonic social media posts, occasionally offered a glimpse of what was going on with his case. In one such post, the politician revealed that a song by a popular Russian rapper praising him was listed as evidence in the case files, and claimed that he made the judge and bailiffs laugh out loud as the song was read out during a court hearing. In another, he said that the case files linked him to U.S. mogul Warren Buffet.\n",
      "Another insight into the trial came from three other prominent imprisoned dissidents: Vladimir Kara-Murza, Ilya Yashin and Alexei Gorinov — they all have revealed in recent weeks that they testified in the trial in Navalny’s favor.\n",
      "In social media statements from behind bars, the three described Navalny as in good spirits and cheerful. Kara-Murza said the trial was “Kafkaesque.” Gorinov said he exchanged jokes with Navalny about similar treatment they both face while in prison. Yashin recalled how Navalny himself was asking him questions during Yashin’s testimony at the hearing, challenging the accusations levelled against him.\n",
      "In his closing statement, Navalny once again described the trial against him as unjust and referred to the recent short-lived armed rebellion by the fighters of Russia’s private military company Wagner, after which their chief and the leader of the mutiny, Yevgeny Prigozhin, walked free, even though a number of Russian soldiers were killed by his troops.\n",
      "READ MORE: Putins reveals he offered Wagner mercenaries the option to stay as a single unit after uprising\n",
      "“Those who were declared traitors to their Motherland and betrayers, in the morning killed several Russian army officers as the entire Russia watched in astonishment, and by lunch agreed on something with someone and went home,” Navalny said.\n",
      "“Thus, law and justice in Russia were once again put in their place. And that place is not prestigious. One sure can’t find them in court,” the politician said.\n",

      "Two of the statutes relate to conspiracy to commit an offense or to defraud the U.S., and deprivation of rights under color of law. The third includes potential charges ranging from obstruction of an official proceeding to tampering with a witness, victim or an informant.\n",
      "Thewas the clearest indication yet that Trump could soon face charges related to his attempts to remain in power after losing the 2020 election. Smith's office has been investigating alleged efforts to interfere with the peaceful transfer of power, including the attack on the Capitol on Jan. 6, 2021, since he was appointed special counsel last November. No charges stemming from this investigation have been filed against the former president, who has denied all wrongdoing and claimed any potential prosecution would be politically motivated.\n",
      "The statutes mentioned in the letter offer some insight into the potential legal basis for possible future charges. Hundreds of defendants in the Justice Department's probe into the Jan. 6 Capitol attack have faced obstruction-related charges. Deprivation of rights under color of law entails using the guise of legal authority to take away constitutional or legal rights.\n",

She just happened to be replacing Australia’s all-time leading scorer, Sam Kerr. The country name on the opposing jerseys just happened to be her father’s homeland.\n",
      "“I feel ready, and everyone feels ready, so whoever is out there you know what you need to do and when you get out there you just play,” Fowler said after Thursday’s 1-0 victory over Ireland, which was making its tournament debut.\n",
      "The 20-year-old Fowler was a replacement in the starting lineup for star striker Kerr, who was ruled out of the tournament co-host's opening match because of a calf muscle injury sustained in practice the previous day.\n",
      "While the news of Kerr’s injury was announced publicly only an hour before kick-off, the team knew about the situation Wednesday night.\n",
      "“I obviously feel for Sam, because it’s such a big tournament and she means so much to this team and this country,” Fowler said.\n",
      "Fowler was born in Cairns in the far northeast of Australia, but played on Ireland’s youth national teams throughout her childhood. She never got a call-up to the Irish senior team.\n",
      "Having an Irish father allowed her to play for either national team until appearing in a competitive match for one of them.\n",
      "When she was 15, the Matildas gave her a chance at the senior level and all but secured her allegiance. That match was not a competitive one, so Ireland was still in the mix for Fowler's representative future. But the Irish federation could not convince her to switch back.\n",
      "Since then, Fowler has scored 10 goals and earned 38 caps for Australia, with Thursday’s the most significant of those.\n",
      "Fowler played 84 minutes against Ireland before being replaced by veteran Clare Polkinghorne. She had some skillful dribbling runs past Irish defenders but wasn't able to create a goal-scoring opportunity for the Matildas like she did in a warmup win the previous week against France.\n",
      "“It’s nice to be able to put the Aussie jersey on, but feel connected to the Irish side,” Fowler said.\n",
      "She’s played against Ireland once before, when she scored twice in a 3-2 loss in a 2021 friendly.\n",
      "Fowler plays her club football for Manchester City in the English Women’s Super League, where she tallied five goals and two assists in 19 games in all competitions this season.\n",
      "Kerr will be evaluated by team medical experts again after the Matildas’ second group-stage match against Nigeria, meaning there'll be at least one more game where somebody has to start in her absence.\n",

      "In the aftermath of Thursday’s byelections, which saw a 21-point average swing against the Tories, some party insiders suggested May 2024 could be an “economic sweet spot” – providing the best window for “damage limitation”.\n",
      "Sunak has come under pressure since the defeats in North Yorkshire and Somerset this week, despite the Tories pulling off a narrow win in Boris Johnson’s former seat in west London.\n",
      "Friday’s results caused some ministers to privately push the government to soften its net zero plans and take a stronger stance on “wedge” issues that could be used to create more of a dividing line with Keir Starmer’s party.\n",
      "The 19,000 and 20,000 majorities that were overturned by Labour and the Liberal Democrats have also renewed jitters among Tory MPs about the safety of their own seat.\n",
      "With talk of a planned cabinet reshuffle towards the end of the summer and pressure on Sunak growing to buoy his party up at its conference in October, attention is turning among a select few in No 10 to the timing of the next election.\n",
      "“Rishi will take a stronger view once we get to next January – when the economic picture is clearer and the new cabinet have had time to bed in,” said one senior Tory source. “But the case for an early election is gaining traction.”\n",
      "Dan Poulter, the Conservative MP for Central Suffolk and North Ipswich, told Times Radio on Sunday: “If we look at historical precedents, at the moment it would suggest that – unless things change and turn around – we’re probably heading for a change of government in 15, 18 months’ time.” He added there was a “slim” chance of victory, but conceded the government was in a “very difficult place”.\n",
      "The idea has been advanced by those including Daniel Finkelstein, a Conservative peer and adviser to John Major in the run up to the party’s crushing defeat in 1997, as well as other figures in parliament and Conservative Central Headquarters.\n",
      "“There are sound reasons for why we’d stand a better chance by going early than in November,” a minister claimed. “But if we are heading for opposition anyway, it would still help us avoid wipeout territory.”\n",
      "Tory strategists point to inflation falling faster than expected – to 7.9% from 8.7% – and hopes that Sunak’s aim to halve inflation will be reached, if not by the end of the year, then in early 2024.\n",
      "“There’s an economic sweep spot,” said one insider. They suggested there would probably be a period next spring where inflation comes under control but before a potential recession and the full effect of further interest rate rises has been felt.\n",
      "Such a move would allow the chancellor, Jeremy Hunt, to store up some intended measures and announce these at the spring budget, in March 2024.\n",
      "The possible giveaways – reported to include abolishing inheritance tax – would be a pre-electoral springboard and challenge for Starmer to match, given his repeated warning that Labour’s ambitions will have to be limited to the finances they inherit.\n",
      "Further advantages to an early election are reducing the potential punishment levied on the Conservative government for rising mortgage payments. Those who have been shielded from the effects of interest rates due to being on relatively low fixed-rate mortgages are gradually seeing their deals expire.\n",
      "“Every person who ends up paying an extra £500 a month because they’ve come off their mortgage deal between the spring and the autumn will end up blaming us,” said one MP. “The quicker we get out the way with a damage limitation early election, the quicker we can be back in power after a spell as the opposition.”\n",
      "Others have pointed to forthcoming fixtures in the political calendar. They fear a narrative-defining drubbing in the May 2024 local elections; followed by another summer where the unresolved small boats issue goes unresolved; and then, as the colder months approach, warnings of an impending winter crisis in the NHS.\n",
      "Party conference, which is also held by the Conservatives in the first week of October, could also prove problematic. It is considered highly unlikely the party would pull or drastically slim down next year’s event before an election in 2024, given how vital it is to fundraising. However, CCHQ sources pointed out that this would mean activists coalescing in Birmingham in a week when their time would be better spent door-knocking across the country.\n",
      "Views differ about when the election, which has to happen by January 2025, is most likely to take place. Some who want Sunak to go later point to the risk of the economy not having recovered enough by next May. They also suggest Sunak may want to make as much headway as possible in clearing the NHS backlog given the difficulties posed by strikes – making a November election more preferable.\n",

      "Rosamund Adoo-Kissi-Debrah's daughter Ella died aged nine in 2013 - partly due to the effects of pollution.\n",
      "She supports the Labour mayor of London's plans to extend the scheme across the whole of the capital.\n",
      "But Labour's leader has said Sadiq Khan should \"reflect\" on the proposals.\n",
      "The expansion of the scheme, due to be enforced from the end of August, would mean drivers of the most polluting cars will have to pay Â£12.50 a day to drive in any part of Greater London.\n",
      "Sir Keir Starmer has blamed the plans for the party's loss at the recent by-election in Uxbridge and South Ruislip, a seat made vacant by the former Conservative prime minister Boris Johnson.\n",
      "Mr Khan has defended his plan as \"the right one\".\n",
      "The scheme has been strongly opposed by motoring groups and some councils. Five Conservative councils have brought a judicial review of the plans to London's High Court. A judge is expected to make a ruling in the coming weeks.\n",
      "Ms Adoo-Kissi-Debrah, who has campaigned for tougher legislation to cut pollution told the BBC on Monday: \"We should this morning be talking about children and the most vulnerable and this has now turned in to a political football\".\n",
      "Ella, from Lewisham, south-east London, was the first person in the UK to have air pollution listed by a coroner as a cause of death.\n",
      "She was found to have been exposed to \"excessive levels\" of toxic air near her home.\n",
      "\"The coroner was very clear that everyone needs to work together - the Department of Heath, transport, the environment, the mayor of London's office and all councils,\" Ms Adoo-Kissi-Debrah said.\n",
      "After Labour's loss at the Uxbridge by-election, Sir Keir said ULEZ was \"the reason we didn't win there\" adding, \"we've all got to reflect on that, including the mayor\".\n",
      "He said he had spoken to Sadiq Khan, but declined to say whether he believed the ULEZ expansion should be paused or scrapped.\n",
      "Sources close to Mr Khan told the BBC he was in \"constructive listening mode\" but added that he had no plans to delay the scheme's expansion at the end of August.\n",
      "In the decade since her daughter's death, Ms Adoo-Kissi-Debrah has campaigned for a new law.\n",
      "\"Mr Khan is legally obligated to clean up the air and so is the government,\" she told Radio 4's Today programme.\n",
      "'People want clean air'\n",
      "When asked whether she was seeing Labour's commitment to cleaning up the air \"wavering\", she said: \"I am\".\n",
      "\"We should be talking about different ways to mitigate ULEZ, that is what we should be discussing. People do want clean air.\"\n",
      "Sir Kier Starmer said on Friday: \"When it comes to green commitments, it's not a question of whether they should be done, of course it needs to be done - it's how they're done.\"\n",

      "KYIV, Ukraine (AP) — Russia pounded Ukraine’s southern cities with drones and missiles for a third consecutive night Thursday, keeping Odesa in the Kremlin’s crosshairs after a bitter dispute over the end of a wartime deal that allowed Ukraine to send grain through the key Black Sea port.\n",
      "The strikes killed at least two people in Odesa. In the nearby city of Mykolaiv, which is close to the Black Sea, at least 19 people were injured, including a child, Ukrainian officials said.\n",
      "Russia has targeted Ukrainian critical grain export infrastructure since it vowed “retribution” this week for an attack that damaged a crucial bridge between Russia and the Moscow-annexed Crimean Peninsula. Russian officials blamed that strike on Ukrainian drone boats.\n",
      "The strikes on Ukraine’s grain export infrastructure have helped drive up food prices in countries facing hunger. U.N. Secretary-General Antonio Guterres said the end of the deal Monday would result in more human suffering, with potentially millions of people affected.\n",
      "The grain deal provided guarantees that ships would not be attacked entering and leaving Ukrainian ports, while a separate agreement facilitated the movement of Russian food and fertilizer.\n",
      "The Russian military on Thursday described its strikes on Odesa, a city whose downtown area is described by the United Nations’ cultural agency UNESCO as possessing “outstanding universal value,” as “retaliatory.”\n",
      "In January, UNESCO added Odesa’s historic center to its list of endangered World Heritage Sites, with UNESCO Director-General Audrey Azoulay saying the “legendary port that has left its mark in cinema, literature and the arts.”\n",
      "Despite multiple Russian artillery attacks and airstrikes during the war that began in February 2022, Odesa had not previously been subjected to the heavy barrages that have targeted other towns and cities in Ukraine’s south and east.\n",
      "Odesa residents reeled from Russia’s sudden focus on their city.\n",
      "“I remember the attack on the port last year, but now it feels like it was only 5% compared to what the Russians have launched at us during these past three days,” Oleksandr Kolodin, a 29-year-old photographer, told The Associated Press.\n",
      "Some feared that Russia’s decision to tear up the grain deal would make Odesa a long-term primary target.\n",
      "“We saw how they could attack Kyiv for an entire month,” said 29-year-old programmer Victor, referring to the intense bombardment of the Ukrainian capital in May. He asked to use only his first name out of concern for his safety.\n",
      "The Russian Defense Ministry said in a statement that it targeted “production shops and storage sites for unmanned boats” in Odesa and the nearby city of Chornomorsk. In the Mykolaiv area, the Russian military claimed to have destroyed Ukrainian fuel infrastructure facilities and ammunition depots.\n",
      "Neither sides’ claims could be independently verified.\n",
      "The previous night, an intense Russian bombardment using drones and missiles damaged critical port infrastructure in Odesa, including grain and oil terminals. The attack destroyed at least 60,000 tons of grain.\n",
      "In what appeared to be a tit-for-tat move, Ukraine’s Defense Ministry announced that as of Friday, all vessels in the Black Sea heading to Russian ports “may be considered by Ukraine as such carrying military cargo with all the associated risks.” That may result in higher insurance costs for those ships.\n",
      "Russia’s Defense Ministry said earlier this week that Moscow had formally declared wide areas of the Black Sea dangerous for shipping and warned that it would view any incoming ship as laden with weapons, effectively announcing a sea blockade.\n",
      "Despite the risks, ship owners haven’t shown any less interest in carrying Ukrainian grain through the Black Sea, according to John Stawpert, senior manager of environment and trade for the International Chamber of Shipping, which represents 80% of the world’s commercial fleet.\n",
      "The European Union’s foreign affairs chief condemned Russia’s targeting of grain storage facilities.\n",
      "“More than 60,000 tons of grain has been burned,” Josep Borrell said in Brussels on Thursday, regarding Moscow’s recent tactics. “So not only they withdraw from the grain agreement … but they are burning the grain.”\n",
      "German Foreign Affairs Minister Annalena Baerbock said at the same meeting that the EU is involved in international efforts to get Ukrainian grain to the world market.\n",
      "“The fact that the Russian president has canceled the grain agreement and is now bombing the port of Odesa is not only another attack on Ukraine, but an attack on the people, on the poorest people in the world,” she said. “Hundreds of thousands of people, not to say millions, urgently need grain from Ukraine.”\n",
      "The White House warned Wednesday that Russia was preparing possible attacks on civilian shipping vessels in the Black Sea. The warning could alarm shippers and further drive up grain prices.\n",
      "Russia has laid additional sea mines in the approaches to Ukrainian ports, White House National Security Council spokesman Adam Hodge said in a statement. “We believe that this is a coordinated effort to justify any attacks against civilian ships in the Black Sea and lay blame on Ukraine for these attacks,” the statement said.\n",
      "Carlos Mera, head of agricultural commodities markets at Rabobank, said wheat prices have risen about 17% over the last week, calling it a surprising rise that started even before the grain deal ended Monday and attributing it to “a little bit of panic.”\n",
      "A lot of the wheat exported from Ukraine goes to very poor countries, such as those in North Africa, he said. People in those places are already struggling with food insecurity and high local food prices. Russia, meanwhile, has been exporting record amounts of wheat in recent months despite complaints that its agricultural exports have been hindered.\n",
      "Russia has blasted Ukrainian towns and cities since the start of the war. Ukraine’s Western allies have helped upgrade its air defense systems. The latest military aid package from the United States, announced by the Pentagon on Wednesday, includes funding for four National Advanced Surface-to-Air Missile Systems, or NASAMS, and munitions for them.\n",
      "Meanwhile, the Ukrainian military has begun deploying cluster munitions — bombs that open in the air and release scores of smaller bomblets — that it recently received from the U.S., U.S. National Security spokesman John Kirby said Thursday at a news conference.\n",
      "“We have gotten some initial feedback from the Ukrainians and they’re using them quite effectively,” he said.\n",

      "Original Article : Republicans to play more selective role in 2024 midterm candidates\n",
      "Establishment Republicans are looking to play a more assertive role in ensuring their preferred candidates win in competitive Senate primaries as they work to flip the upper chamber next year.\n",
      "There’s broad consensus that candidate quality factored in to the party’s failure to take back the Senate in last year’s midterms, with a number of controversial candidates endorsed by former President Trump losing in key states like Pennsylvania, New Hampshire and Georgia.\n",
      "Now, GOP Senate leaders are doing whatever they can to prevent that from happening again in 2024. Sen. Steve Daines (R-Mont.), the current head of the party’s campaign arm, has said he plans to be more active in recruiting candidates and selective in where the National Republican Senatorial Committee (NRSC) sends its support — a departure from his predecessor, Sen. Rick Scott (R-Fla.), who argued it wasn’t his job to interfere in primaries.\n",
      "In West Virginia, for example, Daines is backing Gov. Jim Justice (R) as he runs against fellow Republican Rep. Alex Mooney in the Senate primary. They’re both vying for the seat held by Democrat incumbent Sen. Joe Manchin, who hasn’t said whether he’s running for reelection.\n",
      "In Montana, Daines has been supportive of businessman Tim Sheehy, who is challenging incumbent Democrat Sen. Jon Tester, and said he’d prefer to avoid a contentious primary as Rep. Matt Rosendale (R-Mont.) weighs a bid that could potentially tee up an eventual Tester-Rosendale rematch of their 2018 Senate race.\n",
      "“Senate Republicans have seen the majority slip through their fingers in previous cycles. And they’re so close to regaining the majority, they can taste it. Republicans in 2024 have an opportunity to be on offense, and they’re going to be looking for candidates who can prevail in a general election,” said Jeff Grappone, who led communications for the Senate GOP Conference under Sen. John Barrasso (R-Wyo.), adding that candidate quality “has been an issue” for the party.\n",
      "“It’s understandable after the last cycle, that there would be a desire to have a different approach, a winning approach, to go on offense and to not leave any opportunities on the table,” Grappone said.\n",
      "Given the narrow Senate margin, and “given how high the stakes are, I think it’s the right decision for the NRSC to get involved in primaries,” said GOP strategist Matt Mackowiak, although he added that the decision is “not without some risks.”\n",
      "“A 50-50 Senate could be decisive one way or the other. If you just look at Montana, Ohio and West Virginia, those three — the GOP should be favored in all three of those states if we don’t blow it,” Mackowiak said, noting that states like Arizona and Wisconsin could also be pickup opportunities this time around.\n",
      "“There’s a pathway to Republicans gaining three or more seats this election cycle, and that would be significant. It’s the most advantageous map, Senate map, in my lifetime for Republicans,” Mackowiak said.\n",
      "The election handicapper Cook Political Report rates the Senate races for Manchin’s seat in West Virginia, Democrat Sherrod Brown’s seat in Ohio and Independent Kyrsten Sinema’s seat in Arizona as “toss up” states, while Tester’s seat in Montana and Democrat Bob Casey Jr.’s seat in Pennsylvania are among five posts rated “lean Democrat.”\n",
      "Daines told CBS News last week that the NRSC plans to stay neutral in the Ohio Senate race, where three Republican candidates are now jostling for their party’s nomination in a competitive primary. Ohio Secretary of State Frank LaRose (R) became the latest Republican to announce his candidacy, joining businessman Bernie Moreno and state Sen. Matt Dolan (R).\n",
      "“When you have three candidates [where] anyone could win the general election, we don’t stay up late at night worrying about that,” the Senate campaign arm’s chair said of Ohio in an interview with CBS News.\n",
      "“But if we have a situation where a candidate may not be able to appeal across a broader spectrum, that’s where we’ll be more intentional to try to get candidates that can,” Daines said.\n",
      "But Brian Darling, a GOP strategist and former Senate aide, said establishment Republicans may be setting themselves up for failure by getting involved in primary battles.\n",
      "“I think it’s a mistake for the party to get involved in primaries,” Darling said. “The party has a mixed record on picking preferred candidates and it doesn’t always work out for them”\n",
      "Darling added that the party’s involvement in primaries causes rifts between conservatives and the more establishment-wing candidates, creating problems for the eventual general election.\n",
      "“You end up having these primaries that are pretty, pretty rough-and-tumble, that end up dividing the party and giving ammunition to the Democrats to go after the conservative if the conservative ends up winning,” Darling said.\n",
      "Darling also raised concerns that the NRSC risks “trying to defeat somebody who may eventually win,” which could then create “a lot of distrust with leadership before these members potentially get elected.”\n",
      "Other strategists shrugged off that concern, saying those candidates would have to win a general election first in order for that distrust to become a factor.\n",
      "After a disappointing midterm cycle in which Republicans barely etched out a majority in the House and lost a chance to lead the Senate, many pointed to controversial Trump-backed candidates as at least partially responsible for the failed “red wave.”\n",
      "Now, some Republicans are saying Trump should stay out of the primaries.\n",
      "Daines told CBS News that he’s “getting on the same page” with the former president about endorsements and has endorsed Trump in his 2024 bid to get back to the Oval Office.\n",
      "Darling said endorsements from the former president are “huge” for congressional hopefuls.\n",
      "“That’s a much more important endorsement than the Senatorial Committee or anybody sitting in the U.S. Senate today,” he said.\n",
      "CNN reported this week that Trump has told both Mooney in Montana and Rosendale, if he runs in West Virginia, that they’re unlikely to secure his endorsement.\n",
      "“Certainly, Trump hurt us” in states like Pennsylvania and Arizona last year, Mackowiak said, but it’s “good news” that the former president now seems not to be getting behind “less electable candidates” in places like Montana and West Virginia.\n",
      "“It appears as though, at least as of now, he’s not going to be the problem he’s been in the past,” the GOP consultant said of Trump.\n",
      "The party has also appeared to breathe a sigh of relief that some controversial candidates from last year’s midterms are foregoing getting into next year’s races for both the House and Senate.\n",
      "Pennsylvania’s state Sen. Doug Mastriano (R), who questioned the legitimacy of the 2020 election during his 2022 gubernatorial bid, decided against a 2024 run for Sen. Bob Casey’s (D-Pa.) seat. Endorsed by Trump, Mastriano lost his race last year by 15 points.\n",
      "Others, though, could still jump into Senate races and complicate things for the establishment, like failed Arizona gubernatorial candidate Kari Lake (R), who is considering an upper chamber bid for Sinema’s seat.\n",

      "Original Article : The United Nations has started pumping oil off a decaying vessel moored off Yemen’s Red Sea coast, averting a potential spill and environmental disaster, UN officials have said.\n",
      "The FSO Safer – a floating storage and offloading (FSO) tanker holding more than 1.14 million barrels of oil – has been at risk of breaking up or exploding for years due to its corrosion and a lack of maintenance since a Saudi-led coalition intervened in Yemen’s war in 2015.\n",
      "Yemen’s Houthi rebels, who control the area of Yemen’s coast where the Safer is moored, had previously prevented any salvage operation from taking place, but finally agreed in March to allow for the oil to be offloaded.\n",
      "The oil abroad the Safer will now be transferred into a replacement vessel, called Yemen, in a ship-to-ship transfer that is expected to last 19 days, said the UN Development Programme (UNDP) – the humanitarian agency in charge of implementing the operation.\n",
      "“In the absence of anyone else willing or able to perform this task, the United Nations stepped up and assumed the risk to conduct this very delicate operation,” said UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres on Tuesday.\n",
      "“The ship-to-ship transfer of oil which has started today is the critical next step in avoiding an environmental and humanitarian catastrophe on a colossal scale,” he added.\n",
      "The operation, the first of its kind, is a risky one – but the potential leaking of the remaining oil in the deteriorating tanker that the Yemeni government purchased in the 1980s is even more so.\n",
      "Observers have worried for years that the Safer could crack or explode. The ensuing oil spill would have the potential to wipe out one of the world’s largest marine ecosystems.\n",
      "Once the oil is offloaded, the delivery and instalment of a catenary anchor leg mooring (CALM) buoy will take place, the UN said.\n",
      "The buoy will then be secured to the seabed, which in turn will be used to secure the replacement vessel, a process that must be completed by September, the international body noted.\n",
      "A technical support vessel from the Dutch-based company Boskalis/SMITis would be ready to step in should any oil leaks occur during the operation.\n",
      "The 47-year-old supertanker was left abandoned and has been out of service since the civil war broke out in Yemen eight years ago.\n",
      "The Safer is anchored near the Ras Isa oil terminal controlled by Yemen’s Houthi movement, which in 2015 seized large parts of the country.\n",
      "Mohammed Mudawi from UNDP Yemen told Al Jazeera in mid-July that the vessel had not been properly maintained as it was situated in an area littered with mines. The UN agency team had also been working on preventing the build-up of flammable gases.\n",
      "“We have many concerns that it can explode because of the gases,” Mudawi said.\n",
      "According to the UN, a major spill would destroy coral, mangroves and other sea life; expose millions of people to highly polluted air; devastate fishing communities; force nearby ports to close; and disrupt shipping through the Suez Canal. The cost of the clean-up alone is estimated at $20bn.\n",
      "A spill from the Safer could potentially have an impact greater than one of the largest oil spills in history, the 1989 Exxon Valdez disaster, since the Safer carries four times that amount of oil, according to the UN.\n",

Omar pleaded guilty last Wednesday to three charges: administering a noxious substance with intent to endanger life or cause bodily harm, assault with a weapon, and mischief to religious property with motivation of bias, prejudice or hate based on religion, CBC News reported.\n",

The move will aim to double the EU’s global market share from 10 percent to “at least” 20 percent by 2030, according to a European Council press release.\n",
      "“In the long run, this will also contribute to the renaissance of our industry and the reduction of our foreign dependencies,” Héctor Gómez Hernández, Spanish minister for industry, trade, and tourism, said in a statement. The Chips Act is meant to attract more investment and elevate research in Europe so that the bloc can be ready for future semiconductor shortages and be less reliant on foreign chips.\n",
      "The news comes more than a year after the EU outlined ambitious plans to become a leader in developing and fabricating semiconductor chips. Companies like Intel are already building new manufacturing facilities in the continent.\n",
      "The Chips Act follows after the United States’ increased domestic investments. The US has dedicated $52 billion to compete with China on semiconductor production with the CHIPS and Science Act passed in 2022.

      "|Australia 317 (Labuschagne 51, Marsh 51; Woakes 5-62) & 113-4 (Labuschagne 44*; Wood 3-17)|\n",
      "|England 592 (Crawley 189, Bairstow 99; Hazlewood 5-126)|\n",
      "|Australia are 162 runs behind|\n",
      "|Scorecard|\n",
      "Mark Wood struck crucial late blows in England's battle against Australia and the Manchester weather in the fourth Ashes Test at Old Trafford.\n",
      "Wood, bowling with high pace and hostility, snared 3-17 to leave Australia 113-4, a considerable 162 runs behind.\n",
      "In any other circumstances, England would be huge favourites, yet heavy rain is forecast for the weekend - particularly Saturday's fourth day.\n",
      "The home side's strong position was forged by piling up 592, their highest total in a home Ashes Test since 1985, to take a first-innings lead of 275.\n",
      "Harry Brook made 61 and Ben Stokes 51, but the real pyrotechnics came from Jonny Bairstow, who clobbered a thrilling 99 not out.\n",
      "Bairstow added 66 in a riotous last-wicket partnership with James Anderson and was only denied a deserved hundred when Anderson was lbw to Cameron Green.\n",
      "At 2-1 up in the series and knowing a draw is enough to retain the Ashes, Australia are batting for time and the rain. They lost openers Usman Khawaja and David Warner to Wood and Chris Woakes respectively.\n",
      "Stubborn pair Marnus Labuschagne and Steve Smith quietened the crowd before Wood had Smith caught hooking and bounced out Travis Head.\n",
      "Labuschagne remains unbeaten on 44, an obstacle as large as the weather in the home side's bid to continue an unprecedented English comeback from 2-0 down in an Ashes series.\n",
      "England weigh up weather conundrum\n",
      "Ordinarily, England would be well on course for a series-levelling victory, but could face a race against time win their first Ashes Test on this ground since 1981. If the weather forecast is to be believed, Saturday is a washout and Sunday curtailed.\n",
      "All of this would have been factored into their approach with the bat on Friday. Their stated aim was to get as many runs as possible in the first innings, the theory being that would be the quickest way to win and it is easier to score runs in the first innings than in a tricky second-innings chase.\n",
      "Whether or not England batted too long will only be revealed over the next two days. Their innings did not end until nearly 15:00 BST - later than most would have expected at the beginning of the day.\n",
      "In that time, there was further evidence that Australia have had their minds frazzled by England's aggression. Ambitions of winning the match were abandoned by the first ball of the day, there was noticeable frustration at Pat Cummins' tactics and the chaos caused by Bairstow and Anderson was comical.\n",
      "England find themselves 2-1 down because of the mistakes they made in the first two Tests, but have been superb at Old Trafford to engineer the chance of victory.\n",
      "They now look the superior team and, regardless of the outcome of this match, will go to The Oval as favourites to win the final Test.\n",
      "Wood and Woakes strike vital blows\n",
      "Even if England are set to be hampered by the weather, they will take encouragement from a pitch that is showing increasing evidence of uneven bounce.\n",
      "They were times when Australia were settled - the mini partnerships between Khawaja and Warner, then Labuschangne and Smith - but Wood and Woakes have been difference-makers since coming into the England side for the third Test.\n",
      "Wood needed only two deliveries to have Khawaja poking an edge behind, while Woakes caused enough uncertainty for Warner to play on to his own stumps.\n",
      "Woakes almost had Smith without scoring, only for the third umpire to adjudge an edge had not carried to Joe Root at first slip.\n",
      "Just as Smith was starting to look ominous, Wood switched ends and cranked up the velocity. Smith's top edge to Bairstow was Wood's 100th Test wicket before Head, never comfortable against the short ball, gloved a catch to gully from a 91mph delivery.\n",
      "Labuschagne was joined by Mitchell Marsh, who defended 27 balls for his one not out.\n",
      "Brilliant Bairstow toys with Australians\n",
      "From a platform of 384-4 overnight, England were looking to push forward on Friday morning. Though they added 122 runs in the morning session, it was not the out and out carnage that could have materialised.\n",
      "Brook and Stokes, resuming on 14 and 24 respectively, helped themselves to half-centuries but, with the field back and ball soft, boundaries were hard to come by. When Australia took the second new ball some 10 overs after it became available, Josh Hazlewood removed Brook and Woakes with successive deliveries.\n",
      "It was only when last man Anderson joined Bairstow, who at that point was 49 from 50 balls, did the fun really begin.\n",
      "Bairstow went to 50 by pulling Mitchell Starc for six and the assault was on. Australia spread all nine fielders to the boundary and, just as they did on Thursday, lost control.\n",
      "In an attempt to farm the strike, Bairstow three times pinched a bye to wicketkeeper Alex Carey, a measure of revenge for Carey's controversial stumping in the second Test at Lord's.\n",
      "Bairstow belted three more sixes, one a huge wallop over mid-wicket off Cummins. He took 50 runs off the last 31 balls he faced, with Anderson bravely fending off bouncers and even swiping a four of his own.\n",
      "With Bairstow on 98, he looked for the two to take him to three figures, only to send Anderson back. Next ball, Anderson was palpably leg before to Green, leaving Bairstow as the first England batter stranded on 99 in a Test since Alex Tudor 24 years ago.\n",

      "Hanoi (VNA) – Japan’s discharge of treated radioactive water into the sea will not impact Vietnam’s sea areas, said Deputy Director of the Vietnam Agency for Radiation and Nuclear Safety under the Ministry of Science and Technology Pham Van Toan told the ministry's regular press conference for the second quarter in Hanoi on July 19.\n",
      "Toan said that on March 11, 2011, an incident occurred at the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear power plant in Japan due to the impact of an earthquake and tsunami, resulting in a large amount of radioactive wastewater. To handle this waste, Japan's discharge plan has been assessed by the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) and leading nuclear safety experts based on the IAEA's safety standards. The experts come from 11 countries, including Dr. Nguyen Hao Quang, former Deputy Director of the Vietnam Atomic Energy Institute.\n",
      "On July 4, 2023, after more than two years of working, the IAEA officially handed over an assessment report to the Japanese government, concluding that the Japanese government's plan for the discharge of treated wastewater into the sea is consistent with relevant safety standards.\n",
      "“It should be noted that the total amount of tritium to be released each year in the discharge of Advanced Liquid Processing System (ALPS)-treated water will be well below the amount of these radionuclides produced by natural processes each year, such as interaction of cosmic rays with gases in the upper atmosphere,” the IAEA report said.\n",
      "According to the report, the concentration of radioactive substances in the water at a distance of 30km from the planned discharge location is very small compared to the natural background radiation level in the seawater and has almost no significant impact on the marine environment in terms of radiation.\n",
      "Toan said it can be seen that the radiation impact from the discharge is negligible to both people and the environment in Japan. Consequently, this activity will not have any impact on Vietnam's sea areas.\n",
      "On the occasion, he reiterated the statement made by Vietnamese Foreign Ministry’s spokeswoman Pham Thu Hang in a recent regular press conference that Vietnam supports the development of atomic energy for peaceful purposes. Vietnam believes that the responsibility for ensuring nuclear safety and security lies with the countries using atomic energy. At the same time, Vietnam suggests the need for close international cooperation, transparency in sharing information, responsible behaviour, and compliance with international law in the event of an incident.\n",
      "Vietnam also emphasises the importance of maintaining peace and stability in the region, protecting the marine environment and maritime resources in accordance with international law, the 1982 United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea (UNCLOS), and relevant regulations of the IAEA, he said./.\n",

La medida, que afectará el servicio de este transporte público y del Premetro durante tres horas, fue anunciada el sábado pasado por la Asociación Gremial de Trabajadores del Subte y Premetro (AGTSyP). Desde el gremio reclaman un día más de franco en la semana para reducir, de ese modo, la exposición al asbesto presente en distintas formaciones.\n",
      "Según el cronograma informado, la medida de fuera comenzará con la apertura de molinetes en determinadas estaciones de las diferentes líneas del subte y continuará con la interrupción total del servicio por tres horas.\n",
      "Cómo se desarrollará el paro de subtes del miércoles 26 de julio\n",
      "Según se informó en un comunicado, las medidas de protesta consistirán en aperturas de molinete de 12 a 13 horas en las siguientes estaciones cabeceras:\n",

      "Cuál es el principal reclamo que impulsa el paro de subtes\n",
      "Además, los trabajadores agregaron que “en el transcurso de los últimos cinco años” hicieron “todo lo humanamente posible” para que el gobierno de la Ciudad y la empresa Emova solucionaran la “crisis sanitaria provocada por la presencia del asbesto”. El comunicado lleva la firma del secretario general de la asociación, Roberto Pianelli y del secretario adjunto Néstor Segovia.\n",
      "”Hemos hecho todo lo humanamente posible para que solucionaran la crisis sanitaria provocada por la presencia de asbesto cancerígeno y para que dejen de poner en riesgo la vida de millones de usuarios y trabajadores del subte, sin obtener aún respuesta, al contrario, han cerrado todos los canales de diálogo”, afirmaron desde la agrupación.\n",
      "Por esto, desde AGTSyP indicaron que se ven “obligados” a realizar medidas que afectan al servicio y alertaron que, de no tener avances en relación a las exigencias de desasbestización y la reducción de la jornada laboral, “profundizarán las medidas en los próximos días”.\n",
      "El reclamo apunta a la empresa concesionaria del servicio (Emova) y al Gobierno de la Ciudad. “Denunciamos que siguen negándose a dar respuestas a la crisis sanitaria provocada por este mineral dañino, prohibido desde 2003 y que, sin embargo, no han retirado del ámbito del subterráneo de Buenos Aires”, manifestaron.

      "Almost half of voters in a poll released Wednesday said that they would consider casting their ballot for a third-party presidential candidate in the 2024 election.\n",
      "The Quinnipiac University poll found that 47 percent said they would consider voting for a third-party candidate, while another 47 percent said they would not.\n",
      "Independents were much more likely than Democrats or Republicans to say they would consider voting for a candidate not running under a major party banner. While 64 percent of Independents they would consider a third-party ticket, just 35 percent of Democrats and 38 percent of Republicans said the same.\n",
      "“With neither President Biden nor former President Trump knocking it out of the park on favorability, almost half of the country would consider another option,” Tim Malloy, a Quinnipiac University polling analyst, said in a press release.\n",
      "“No specific name for the candidate, no specific designation for the party, but it is a vivid indication that for many voters, the status quo is a no-go,” he added.\n",
      "As the 2024 race heats up, it appears increasingly likely that the election will be a Biden-Trump rematch. Biden, who is facing challenges from two long-shot Democratic candidates, sits well ahead of both, with 71 percent support among Democratic and Democratic leaning voters, the poll found.\n",
      "Trump is also the clear frontrunner in a crowded Republican field, garnering 54 percent among Republican and Republican leaning voters, the poll found. His closest competitor, Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis, sits 29 points behind.\n",
      "However, both Biden and Trump have low favorability ratings. While 40 percent of voters in the poll said they had a favorable opinion of the incumbent president, 38 percent said the same of the former president.\n",
      "The poll underlines Democratic concerns that third-party candidates could help hand the election to Trump, should he win the GOP primary.\n",
      "Professor and activist Cornel West has already launched his presidential bid as the People’s Party candidate.

      "Original Article : Thousands of scaffolding that are both ubiquitous and widely regarded as eyesores in New York City may come down quicker under a plan unveiled Monday by Mayor Adams.\n",
      "Under current regulations, building owners are required to erect scaffolding when conditions exist that could result in debris falling from a structure’s facade. But the rules also grant owners wide latitude around how long those protective structures can remain up — with some becoming part of the cityscape for longer than a decade.\n",
      "For many landlords, it’s less expensive to erect the sheds and delay repairs than it is to do the repairs in a timely manner.\n",
      "But Adams is hoping to turn that incentive structure on its head. On Monday he laid out a roadmap on how to accomplish that goal — including proposed fines that would be tied to how long a sidewalk shed remains up and new aesthetic requirements for the temporary structures.\n",
      "“City rules are incentivizing property owners to leave sheds up and put off critical work,” Adams said at a press conference in Chelsea. “Most sheds stay up for longer than a year, and some have darkened our streets for more than a decade. We have normalized the sheds all over our city, and that is unacceptable.”\n",
      "Adams held his announcement outside a Seventh Ave. building that had scaffolding up for about 20 months prior to the press conference. According to Manhattan Borough President Mark Levine, the scaffolding came down after the property owner got wind of Adams’ announcement.\n",
      "Right now, there are about 9,000 permitted sheds in use throughout the city, according to city data. Those sheds, on average, have been up for 497 days and span nearly 400 miles, or about 3% of the city’s sidewalk space. Last year, the city’s Independent Budget Office revealed that the use of scaffolding on city streets has tripled over the past 20 years.\n",
      "To get them down faster, Adams and Levine are planning to push for new legislation that would create a fine structure to be applied to sheds erected for building repairs.\n",
      "Under the plan, fines would start kicking in 90 days after a shed is first permitted and could run from between $6,000 to $10,000 per month, depending on the building’s location. Landlords with sheds covering buildings in Midtown Manhattan, Downtown Brooklyn, Long Island City and on the Grand Concourse in the Bronx would be subject to $10,000 penalties under the plan.\n",
      "“Once a sidewalk shed goes up, the clock starts ticking. At 90 days, the first penalties are issued. So you have to act,” Deputy Mayor Meera Joshi said. “Every month thereafter, until repairs are complete, we’ll issue another penalty.”\n",
      "Buildings Department Commissioner Jimmy Oddo said the city doesn’t intend to be inflexible when issuing fines, though, noting that when repair work begins, “we’ll have conversations about the fines that have been issued.”\n",
      "The penalties outlined by Joshi and Oddo would require City Council approval. While the mayor’s relationship with the Council has been frosty lately, Adams has at least two supporters on the lawmaking body, Council members Gale Brewer and Keith Powers who were both on hand to back Adams in his announcement Monday.\n",
      "Inside NYC Politics\n",
      "Brewer suggested that some negotiations over the finer points of the plan could be in the offing, though. After Adams and several other top city officials spoke Monday, she noted that while some landlords have the means to make their repairs more quickly, others — like church and synagogue owners — might delay in doing so due to a lack of cash.\n",
      "Brewer said she was heartened that the administration included in its plan a low-interest loan program to provide aid for struggling small property owners that might not have the financial wherewithal to work within the city’s new shed-removal timeframe.\n",
      "The specific contours of that loan program, however, are not yet entirely clear.\n",
      "Other measures laid out by Adams include replacing sheds with netting in cases were it’s safe to do so. Safety netting for facade work is currently permitted, but rarely used due to a lack of standardized netting designs, according to city officials. To encourage the use of netting, the Buildings Department plans to issue a new bulletin with specific rules pertaining to its use.\n",
      "That agency is also planning to request new proposals for more aesthetically pleasing shed designs to replace the pipe-and-plywood structures most New Yorkers have become inured to over the years. The updated designs will require better lighting and allow for art to be placed on shed panels, according to city officials.\n",
      "Adams would not say definitively whether or not such aesthetic standards might be extended to other parts of the city landscape — like store awnings, for example — but hinted that policies along similar lines might be in the works.\n",
      "“Everything is on the table,” the mayor said. “As we reach a point of announcement, we will do something like this.”\n",

      "Dame Alison Rose said she was \"wrong\" to respond to questions from the BBC about his bank account being closed.\n",
      "The ex-UKIP leader had demanded NatWest explain how his financial information was made public as the row over his bank account closure escalated.\n",
      "NatWest said it still had full confidence in Dame Alison at the helm.\n",
      "Dame Alison's apology comes after the BBC apologised on Monday for its inaccurate report earlier this month which said Mr Farage no longer met the wealth threshold for Coutts, citing a source familiar with the matter.\n",
      "Mr Farage later secured a Coutts report which indicated his political views were considered.\n",
      "Dame Alison said in conversations with BBC business editor Simon Jack \"believing it was public knowledge\" she had confirmed that Mr Farage was a Coutts customer and he been offered a NatWest bank account.\n",

      "Original Article : MIAMI -- After two diagnosed concussions derailed an MVP-caliber season in 2022, Miami Dolphins quarterback Tua Tagovailoa's priority entering this offseason was learning how to better protect himself.\n",
      "So he made an interesting choice.\n",
      "\"I've been falling a lot this offseason,\" Tagovailoa said.\n",
      "But it's by design. One day each week, Tagovailoa trains in jiu-jitsu. From learning how to fall to making contact less of a shock to his system, jiu-jitsu has become an important part of Tagovailoa's regimen as he looks to reduce the possibility of future head injuries.\n",
      "\"For guys at my position, we barely get hit throughout practices, throughout the offseason, even going into training camp,\" Tagovailoa said. \"We don't even get touched until the season starts.\n",
      "\"So I mean, with jiu-jitsu, I've been thrown airborne, I've been put in many uncomfortable positions for me to learn how to fall and try to react throughout those positions that I'm getting thrown around in.\"\n",
      "As the Dolphins surged to an 8-3 record last season, Tagovailoa was running one of the league's top offenses. But injuries, including the concussions and an apparent head injury in Week 3 that ultimately prompted the NFL to change its policy on evaluating concussions, caused him to miss the better part of six games, including the playoff loss to the Buffalo Bills. It inspired an unconventional approach to this offseason by a team that again has Super Bowl aspirations.\n",
      "\"It's really hard sometimes for me to even remember [who came up with the idea of jiu-jitsu],\" Dolphins coach Mike McDaniel said. \"I know [quarterbacks] coach [Darrell] Bevell was spitballing some problem-solving things that we could do. [Strength and conditioning coach] Dave Puloka and [head athletic trainer] Kyle Johnston were very involved in all this stuff.\"\n",
      "Regardless of whose idea it was, Tagovailoa is following through. And it makes sense to at least one world-class fighter whose talents helped her become an MMA champion.\n",
      "\"When you're in a specific sport, you're using the same muscles over and over and over again,\" said Kayla Harrison, a two-time Olympic gold medalist in judo. \"You're breaking those [muscles] down and wearing those down. So in the offseason, to train and use your brain in a different way, to use different muscles is I think super beneficial to athletes, and I think science shows that as well.\n",
      "\"MMA is a really tough one to pick ... but I love it. I love that they want to get in there, get beat up a little bit and learn how to fight, I think that's awesome. And I do think it's beneficial for football, for sure.\"\n",
      "'Why haven't we detailed this before?'\n",
      "Some fighters don't watch videos of themselves getting knocked out, but for Tagovailoa, it was important.\n",
      "He rewatched the hits he took during the 2022 season, including the one in Week 4 that resulted in him being taken off the field via stretcher and having a brief stay in a Cincinnati hospital.\n",
      "\"It wasn't tough to watch,\" Tagovailoa said. \"I want to get better at everything that I can do to help the team win games, and I know the biggest one is my health, staying out on the field. And so looking at the film, I was able to watch that with my jiu-jitsu coach, and we were able to kind of relive the scenario in how I got tackled, how I fell.\n",
      "\"And it wasn't just one particular game. It was multiple ways that I got taken down and how I could have prevented that.\"\n",
      "The training included Tagovailoa being placed in recreated scenarios that mirrored situations he faced last season.\n",
      "\"It's a lot of strategic falling that is patterned after things that happened to our quarterbacks during the season,\" McDaniel said. \"So kind of recreating those things, because the master of jiu-jitsu had to study some game tape to understand how he was falling, where the impact points were, and what we could do to help correct it.\"\n",
      "Tagovailoa strengthened his neck and core muscles through his jiu-jitsu training, to a point where a source with knowledge of the situation told ESPN he is \"the strongest he's ever been.\"\n",
      "Initially, Tagovailoa told USA Today he was training in judo, before McDaniel publicly corrected him a few weeks later. The two forms of martial arts are fairly similar -- they're \"sisters,\" even, according to Harrison.\n",
      "\"They both have some of the same moves,\" she said. \"In judo, you can choke, you can armbar; and in jiu-jitsu, you do chokes, armbars, heel hooks. You can also do takedowns in jiu-jitsu, but the focus is really different.\n",
      "\"Where in judo the focus is a lot on throws -- big, exciting throws. The focus in jiu-jitsu is more on submission.\"\n",
      "Tagovailoa said his training has focused on grappling and dispersing energy while falling, while also remembering to tuck his chin on his way to the ground.\n",
      "\"It kind of looks like bullying,\" McDaniel said. \"Like it's just a guy being attacked and going to the ground. And then how to transfer energy to disperse it and not have a central impact focus. It's something that makes you think, 'Hey, why haven't we detailed this before?'\"\n",
      "'Excited to see his progress'\n",
      "With pads popping and fighters grunting, Harrison extended an invitation to Tagovailoa to train at her gym, American Top Team, in Coconut Creek, Florida. South Florida is a hotbed for mixed martial arts, and ATT has produced some of the top MMA fighters in the world.\n",
      "\"If he wants to come by American Top Team and get a lesson from a two-time Olympic champion, I'm more than willing to help him,\" Harrison said. \"He's always welcome here.\n",
      "\"I'm excited to see his progress.\"\n",
      "Tagovailoa should be in the area for a while. After the Dolphins picked up his fifth-year option in March, Tagovailoa is expected to remain in Miami for at least the next two seasons. Meanwhile, McDaniel is entering his second season in Miami, which means Tagovailoa will have the same playcaller in back-to-back years for the first time since Miami drafted him in 2020.\n",
      "If he remains healthy, there's little reason to believe the Dolphins won't again possess one of the NFL's most potent offenses. But Tagovailoa wasn't the only Dolphins quarterback to sustain injuries last season. All three of their quarterbacks were injured at some point in 2022, so McDaniel said the team has incorporated jiu-jitsu training into its drill work with the quarterbacks, although he didn't go into specifics.\n",
      "\"As a quarterback, September starts and then you get tackled,\" McDaniel said. \"And then you get tackled for six months, and then you don't again until September. So how can we help train quarterbacks to stay healthy? And that's something that that whole offseason training has really helped us try to take a good step in the right direction for how to best prepare players for an NFL season.\n",
      "\"By and large, you find out that core strength is very much important when you're talking about the transfer of energy of the human body going to the ground, and different things that you can do to minimize that are strategic, but then strengthening of the core so that when you're going to the ground, the top of your torso isn't just a leverage whipping device.\"\n",
      "Tagovailoa has bulked up from 217 to 225 pounds this offseason while maintaining his mobility. The quarterback is focused on preparing for a pivotal season, after which he could sign a sizable contract extension.\n",
      "\"I've seen a guy that has followed through on his words as much as any young man I've come across in my career,\" McDaniel said. \"You talk about going above and beyond.\"\n",

      "The incident on the Fourth of July in Circleville has led to an investigation as to why the officer allowed the K9 to attack Jadarrius Rose, 23, following a “lengthy” pursuit involving a tractor-trailer, Reuters reports.\n",
      "According to NBC News, the chase started Ohio 35 when Rose refused to stop his tractor-trailer for a Motor Carrier Enforcement inspector. The tractor-trailer rose was driving was missing a mudflap, reports say.\n",
      "State Highway Patrol troopers were called in to help and stop-sticks were used twice on Ohio 23 to end the chase, NBC News reports. Authorities say Rose initially refused to get out of the truck. He eventually got out of the driver’s side door, but then ignore orders to get on the ground, reports say.\n",
      "Video from a body camera shows an officer with the Circleville Police Department holding back the K9 as troopers yell for Rose to get on the ground with his hands up. Rose eventually does get on his knees with his hands in the air.\n",
      "A trooper then can be heard repeatedly yelling at the Circleville officer “Do not release the dog with his hands up!” However, the officer lets the dog go and it can be seen in the video attacking Rose. The trooper can be heard yelling repeatedly, “Get the dog off of him!” Rose also can be heard screaming in pain and yelling “Get it off of me!”\n",

      "Anti-tank obstacles on a wheat field at a farm in southern Ukraine's Mykolaiv region. The country's grain exports were curtailed this week when Russia pulled out of a deal that allowed grain-laden ships to sail out of Ukrainian ports.\n",
      "Genya Savilov /AFP via Getty Images\n",
      "On July 17 the Russian government announced that it was pulling out of a deal to facilitate the export of millions of tons of grain from Ukrainian ports. The arrangement had been in place since July 2022. The Kremlin's move immediately sparked concern, particularly in food insecure countries. The Kenyan government was quick to denounce the withdrawal as a \"stab in the back\" for drought-hit nations in the Horn of Africa. U.N. Secretary General Antonio Guterres said that Russia's withdrawal \"will strike a blow to people in need everywhere.\"\n",
      "Grain prices have been fluctuating since. On Monday morning after the announcement, Chicago wheat futures – a global benchmark for prices – briefly jumped around 3% before falling later in the day. By Wednesday afternoon Russia announced that all ships in the Black Sea bound for Ukrainian ports will be considered potential military cargo starting Wednesday. Wheat futures jumped 9%.\n",
      "Monday's withdrawal announcement came hours after explosions damaged a bridge connecting Russia with the annexed Crimean peninsula. Moscow blamed the incident on Ukraine but said the attack was unconnected to the termination of the grain deal. On Tuesday, Moscow launched a barrage of missiles against the Ukrainian port city of Odessa, a key export point for grain.\n",
      "The Ukraine grain crisis unfolded in March 2022, when Russia invaded its neighbor. Ukraine had been one of the world's largest exporters of grain and sunflower oil, which reached hundreds of millions of people in low-resource countries. Russian forces imposed a naval blockade on Ukrainian ports, immediately engulfing the world in a food security crisis. Food prices soared as millions of tons of grain exports were stranded for five months.\n",
      "Hope arrived in July 2022: Turkey and the U.N. negotiated the Black Sea Grain Initiative, enabling cargo ships to pass safely out of Ukrainian ports to the Bosporus Strait. From there a joint inspection by Ukrainian, Russian, Turkish and U.N. officials – checking to see that no weapons are on board — and vessels proceed to their destinations around the world. According to the World Food Programme, the initiative allowed over 725,000 tons of wheat to be shipped to Afghanistan, Yemen, and east Africa.\n",
      "But the deal was far from perfect. Joseph Glauber, senior research fellow at the International Food Policy Research Institute (IFPRI), says Russia has been criticized for dragging their heels on inspections and repeatedly threatening to pull out of the deal.\n",
      "\"Having said that,\" he added, \"you're still talking about 33.5 million tons of agricultural product going out last year, which is remarkable.\"\n",
      "Glauber says that the suspension of the deal is \"unfortunate\" and exacerbates an already difficult situation. Export costs have been rising since the war, storage capacity has been tight and with some fields now in occupied areas, Ukrainian production is down 35-40%.\n",
      "\"The reality is that there is less grain to ship. If Ukraine will be producing half the amount it usually does over the next year or so, that's a deficit the world has to make up.\"\n",
      "International aid charities are keen to point out that for people living in low resource countries, the situation was already perilous before the war in Ukraine.\n",
      "Elise Nalbandian, regional hunger crisis advocacy manager for Oxfam in Africa, says that food, fuel, and fertilizer in east Africa were already expensive due to regional conflicts and the climate crisis.\n",
      "\"(The grain deal) was an important diplomatic solution for a conflict that is affecting the whole world, but the bigger issue is that the food system globally is inconvertibly broken,\" she told NPR from Nairobi. \"It is only when something like the Black Sea grain initiative stops, then everyone pays attention to how unfortunate the situation has become.\"\n",
      "Of particular concern is the Horn of Africa, where years of insufficient rainfall have caused the worst drought in forty years, threatening millions with famine. According to the World Health Organization, last year's drought claimed 40,000 lives in Somalia alone due to malnutrition.\n",
      "Nalbandian says that the new blockage of Ukraine's grain should be seen in the wider context of poor access to food for countries in need\n",
      "\"Africa has 60% of world's cultivatable land, and the fact it is a net importer of food is a scandal. We must diversify production and invest in small-scale farmers, specifically women farmers in low-income countries.\"\n",
      "Nana Ndeda, who is the humanitarian, advocacy and policy lead for Save the Children International, told NPR that the halting of the deal \"worries us.\"\n",
      "\"We predict there will be another spike in hunger,\" said Ndeda, who added that food disruptions are contributing to increased pressures on national health systems in the neediest places.\n",
      "\"Areas like the Horn of Africa and the Sahel have suffered from chronic food insecurity for a long time. Families skip meals and eat less nutritious food. This leads to an increase in malnutrition, which harms immune systems and causes outbreaks of fast-spreading diseases like measles and cholera.\"\n",
      "Ndeda points to the need to provide relief to stricken countries' hamstrung economies, who owe billions of dollars to China and private western lenders.\n",
      "\"One way to address the future resilience of these countries is the renegotiation of debts, especially in sub-Saharan Africa, to allow them to have more resources to strengthen food security systems.\"\n",
      "Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan said on Monday that despite Russia's curtailment of the deal, he believes that Vladimir Putin wants the grain deal to continue. Some speculate that Russia may demand relief from sanctions imposed by the West in exchange for its resumption. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy suggested that the arrangement can continue without Russian participation, though it is unclear who would provide security guarantees for the grain-carrying ships.\n",
      "Joseph Glauber from IFPRI says that the situation last year was helped by bumper harvests in Canada and Australia, as well as other producers like India and Brazil experiencing a good crop, but stocks worldwide are still not replenishing at significant levels to withstand the unexpected.\n",
      "\"There's not a lot of buffer to absorb another big exporting region having a serious drought. That's the main concern,\" he warned.\n",

      "The first round of group stage matches at the 2023 FIFA Women's World Cup has come to an end, but fear not; there are still plenty of games left to be played.\n",
      "We asked our panel of soccer experts here at FOX Sports which of the remaining group stage matches they're most excited for — here's what they had to say:\n",
      "Which group stage matchup that we haven't seen yet are you most excited about?\n",
      "Carli Lloyd: France-Brazil. France has been injected with more confidence and belief from their newly appointed manager Herve Renard. Brazil is thriving right now and have many players who have been in form for their clubs and Brazil.\n",
      "Alexi Lalas: Any game that the eight debutants play. Seeing the pride and happiness on the faces of these players is awesome. Just their mere presence can help motivate, inspire, and energize cultures that traditionally haven’t looked at the women’s game as worthy of attention or resources.\n",
      "Stu Holden: USA-Netherlands. As a rematch of the 2019 final, I think it’s going to be a close and exciting match. It's a good early test for the USWNT and one in which we’ll find out if they have what it takes for the 3-peat.\n",
      "Leslie Osborne: USA-Netherlands. A lot has changed for both teams since 2019. Who will come out on top?\n",
      "Jimmy Conrad: Spain-Japan. Spain has the back-to-back reigning Ballon d’Or winner, Alexia Putellas, who is coming off a 10-month layoff due to an ACL tear, on their team, and Japan have one of the best young players in the world on theirs in 19-year-old Maika Hamano, who is heading to Chelsea next season. They're both the real deal. But that’s on the player level.\n",
      "On a team level, Spain has the talent to win this tournament but have some major off-the-field distractions with their federation and coaching. Meanwhile, Japan, after winning the World Cup in 2011 and being finalists in 2015, crashed out in the round of 16 in 2019, so they’re going to be looking to restore their reputation as one of the world’s best.\n",
      "Laken Litman: USA-Netherlands. What’s juicer than a 2019 World Cup final rematch in the group stage?\n",
      "Doug McIntyre: USA.-Netherlands. Not only is it a rematch of the 2019 finale, I can’t remember the Americans ever having a more meaningful first round game at a World Cup. If the USWNT loses, they’ll almost certainly finish second in the group. And you know the Dutch will be up for it after what happened four years ago in France.\n",
      "Martin Rogers: Aside from USA-Netherlands, I’d go for Australia-Canada. One of the host nations against the Olympic champion in a game both teams will likely be desperate to win, as second place in the group may mean a round of 16 meeting with England.\n",

      "Original Article : By Fernando Heller | EuroEFE.EURACTIV.es Est. 5min 21-07-2023 Content-Type: News News Based on facts, either observed and verified directly by the reporter, or reported and verified from knowledgeable sources. “We cannot call everything a marriage (because if we do so) tomorrow we could also call marriage a union of a person with a cat”, Latorre told the local website Enciende Cuenca in an interview, quoted by EURACTIV’s partner EFE. [Shutterstock/Alexandre Rotenberg] EURACTIV is part of the Trust Project >>> Print Email Facebook Twitter LinkedIn WhatsApp Telegram One cannot call marriage a union of two people of the same sex, it would be more appropriate to define it as a union between a person and an animal, Mariano Latorre, candidate of the far-right VOX – party in the province of Cuenca (centre-south) said on Thursday, two days ahead of Spain’s general elections. The issue of LGBTQ+ rights has been at the centre of the political parties’ attention during the campaign for the general elections and has also been one of the most controversial issues in the three election debates that have been held on the Iberian country’s television, the last of them on Wednesday evening. “We cannot call everything a marriage (because if we do so) tomorrow we could also call marriage a union of a person with a cat”, Latorre told the local website Enciende Cuenca in an interview, quoted by EURACTIV’s partner EFE. Following the offensive comments by VOX’s candidate for the province of Cuenca, the president of the socialist party (PSOE/S&D) in the region, Sergio Gutiérrez, has called for the urgent resignation of the “ultra” politician. Without your ‘own’ children there can be no ‘marriage’ “Marriage, as its own name indicates, is a union of a man and a woman that is supposed to bring with it an offspring”, explained the VOX politician in the interview, in which he also touched upon other controversial issues like immigration – echoing other ideologically related parties, like Meloni’s Fratelli D’Italia. “When in Spain, in the 1940s, there was very strong immigration to other European countries, like Germany, France. The Spaniards who entered did not arrive, throwing acid in the face of the policemen to enter through the border. They didn’t arrive stealing, raping women, occupying houses”, Latorre stated. These Spanish immigrants adapted to the customs of the countries where they settled to live, “they worked, paid their taxes and were welcome,” he added. “We do the same, anyone who comes here legally, who knocks on our door and who adapts to our way of life or, at least, who is compatible with it, is welcome, particularly if they work and contribute” to Spanish society, Latorre added. According to the local branch of PSOE, the VOX candidate should not be allowed to participate in Sunday’s elections. His insulting and degrading words disqualify him from taking part in democratic elections, the socialist party claims. Meanwhile, Gutiérrez pointed out that responsibility does not only lie with VOX but “also with the PP (centre-right Partido Popular)” as it is (PP/EPP) “an ally of the far-right-wing party”. In Gutiérrez’s words, this is a clear example “of what the next four years could mean for the Spanish people” if Partido Popular, currently the main opposition force, and Vox forge a coalition to govern at the national level. A VOX deputy PM? In addition, he called it “intolerable” that a person who thinks this way and makes these statements should be allowed to be a candidate for a political party in Spain. If both the PP and Vox have “a minimum of democratic conscience or ethical convictions”, they should request the immediate resignation of VOX’s head of the list in Cuenca. “It is humiliating that there are candidates (…) aspiring to (become) deputies (at the national level) who think that there are homosexuals who can be dogs”, the socialist politician added. Spain’s general elections on Sunday could radically change the country’s political map. The polls point to a victory for the PP, which, if it does not obtain an absolute hierarchy of 176 seat majority (176 seats out of 350), would have to make a pact with VOX, as it has already done at the regional and municipal levels after the local elections held on 28 May. If the PP, led by Alberto Núñez Feijóo and VOX, led by Abascal, manage to govern, it would be an unprecedented and historic event as it would be the first time in more than 40 years that far-right ministers – or even an “ultra” deputy prime minister- would enter a national government in Spain. The question remains whether the progressive bloc forged by Sánchez and Diaz’s Sumar platform will win more seats than the right-wing and far-right bloc combined. If they succeed, they could re-edit a new left-wing alliance to govern the country for another four years.

      "Original Article : When the British government shared guidance earlier this month for those looking to honor Queen Elizabeth II with the use of her name and title on projects across the country, they added in one tantalizing detail: planning will begin “in due course” on the official national monument to Queen Elizabeth II. On Friday, The Telegraph reported that the government is working “hand in hand” with the royal household to form a committee for the national monument, the members of which will be announced by the anniversary of the late queen’s death.\n",
      "Previous official monuments to a late monarch, like the white marble Queen Victoria Memorial outside of Buckingham Palace, have become popular tourist attractions. Though unofficial monuments to the queen—many of which involved donated Paddington Bear stuffed animals—erupted spontaneously across the nation in the days after her death on September 8, they were quickly cleared after her funeral 10 days later.\n",
      "The official monument to the previous monarch, King George VI, was unveiled at St. James Park in London in 1955, three years after his death. Funded through a national campaign announced by Winston Churchill, it consists of a sculpture designed by William McMillan which shows the king wearing his naval uniform. In 2009, a statue of the Queen Mother, depicting her in Order of the Garter robes during the years after she was widowed, was added nearby.\n",
      "In its guidance, the government noted that unofficial monuments to the late queen do not need approval unless they have a commercial component. “Communities, organizations and individuals may wish to mark the passing of Her Majesty Queen Elizabeth II and commemorate her extraordinary reign through the use of her name and title, for example by naming a park, garden or street,” the guidance read. “The full title of Queen Elizabeth II will continue to be closely protected and only be granted for applications with strong royal connections.”\n",
      "Last November, King Charles III visited York Minster to unveil the first permanent monument to Queen Elizabeth II, a seven-foot limestone statue of the queen wearing her Order of the Garter robes on the exterior of the cathedral. In his speech at the event, Charles noted that the statue was originally planned to honor the queen’s Platinum Jubilee celebrations, which also took place in 2022.\n",
      "“Now, as we have witnessed, with great sadness, the passing of that reign, it is unveiled in her memory, as a tribute to a life of extraordinary service and devotion,” he added. “The late Queen was always vigilant for the welfare of her people during her life.

Lawmakers capped the time off at 20 weeks with a 12-week limit on the type of leave. Earlier versions of the bill had allowed for workers to take up to 12 weeks for their own health issues and 12 weeks for a family member in the same calendar year.\n",
      "\"The vast majority of nations have this because they know it's the right thing to do,\" Walz said. \"They also know it's the right thing to do to build your economy, to make it resilient and strong and healthy.\"\n",
      "The new law doesn't go into effect until 2026, but any tweaks are likely to be minimal. Even if Republicans win a majority in next year's House elections, there is little chance any meaningful change will take place.\n",
      "\"You start thinking about this stuff, and you think, 'Holy s***, they're going to put us all out of business,\" Sweeney said. \"I've worked my ass off for this company.\"\n",
      "Innovated Building Concepts, which has less than 20 employees, opened its doors in 1987. Sweeney and her husband Pat bought the place in 2011, and the company's portfolio includes a Crayola installation, the US Bank Stadium parking ramp, LL Bean at the Mall of America, Dave & Buster's, and the Killebrew pedestrian bridge.\n",
      "\"When we first started, we didn't take paychecks. It was 2016 before we actually took a full salary,\" she said, adding that she once worked 50 days in a row. Despite the blood, sweat, and tears the couple has poured into the business, their future remains uncertain.\n",
      "The same can be said for Mike Flynn, a small business owner in southeastern Minnesota, who owns a small ranch, has an interest in the Whitewater Travel Plaza and Restaurant off Highway 190, and is a dentist.\n",
      "The day the Washington Examiner caught up with him, he was wearing his dentist hat.\n",
      "\"They don't know the storm that they created,\" he said. \"To be a legislator, you don't have to be a business person, and you don't have to major in mathematics or balance a checkbook. You have advisers who tell you how sweet and perfect this is going to be, but the devil is in the detail. What is the unintended consequence of this passage?\"\n",
      "Flynn said a comparison between Minnesota's law and those in other states points to some troubling signs.\n",
      "\"The Minnesota one is the most aggressive, loose one in the country, second to nobody as far as how extensive they want this to be,\" he said, adding that the state is already facing a labor shortage and small businesses are struggling to hire everyone from \"dental hygienists to clerks, cooks, and servers\" that are not only \"hard to find but hard to replace on a temporary basis.\"\n",
      "Flynn said there are too many questions that still need answering, such as who pays for medical insurance if an employee works two jobs and whether employers will be required to match 401(k) contributions when employees are on leave.\n",
      "John Reynolds, state director for the National Federation of Independent Businesses, which represents more than 10,000 small business owners in the state, told the Washington Examiner that they feel \"betrayed\" by their elected officials.\n",
      "\"The idea that they turned their backs on us really captures how most small business owners feel here,\" he said, adding that they had to navigate the pandemic and well as inflation and supply chain shortage headwinds. \"We had the biggest surplus by far the state has ever had, and [small business owners] feel like that's the product of their hard work. Being the economic backbone of a lot of parts of the state, I think they thought, 'Hey, this is going to be a time when we get some relief.'\"\n",
      "For their part, Democratic lawmakers have touted their accomplishments this session and have rebranded themselves as friends of small business.\n",
      "\"It's a really puzzling conclusion from the session,\" Reynolds said. \"The taxes are just part of the story. Minnesota is a really expensive place to live and an expensive place to do business... You name it, we tax it.\"\n",
      "Minnesota was ranked the most expensive state for new entrepreneurs, according to a July state-by-state comparison from online small business adviser SimplifyLLC. The state also has the country's highest corporate income tax rate at 9.8% and has high labor costs.\n",
      "“I am not surprised,” state GOP Rep. Natalie Zeleznikar told the Duluth News Tribune about the No. 1 ranking, adding that the legislation passed in this year's session was akin to a \"war on small business.\"\n",
      "For Sweeney, it's heartbreaking to imagine what the next few years could hold for her company.\n",
      "\"We're small. We can't absorb that kind of money,\" she said. \"Almost everything they passed is going to hurt small businesses. You shouldn't be allowed to run for legislator unless you've run a small business yourself so you know what a real budget is and what it takes. What you take away from us, you take away from the next person and the next.\"\n",
      "The Washington Examiner reached out to Democratic leadership in the state and Walz's office multiple times for comment but did not receive a response.\n",

      "Original Article : Is there anything in science more exciting than when an ancient legend is confirmed by modern research?\n",
      "Archaeologists in Mexico were able to experience this exact triumph when they found evidence that a mythical underground city lies undisturbed beneath the altar of a church—exactly where a Spanish legend stated it would.\n",
      "In the time of Babylon, there emerged from Mexico’s Oaxaca Valley a culture known as the Zapotec which could create monumental stone architecture, sophisticated crafts and artwork, as well as a written and spoken language that predated Mayan, Mixtec, and Aztec. They were among Mesoamerica’s first great civilizations, and existed longer than perhaps any other, from 700 BCE to the time of Spanish conquests when they were part of the Aztec Empire.\n",
      "Legend has it that the Zapotec built a great labyrinthine city called “Lyobaa,” or “place of rest,” centered around a large cavity found in the earth which they believed was the gateway to the underworld.\n",
      "Later, venturing Spanish missionaries were so repulsed and frightened to explore more than a few yards into the tunnel network that they “ordered [the] infernal gate to be thoroughly closed with masonry,” wrote a Dominican chronicler named Francisco Burgoa.\n",
      "Now, a collaboration between the Mexican National Institute of History and Anthropology (INAH), the National Autonomous University of Mexico (UNAM), and the Association for Archaeological Research and Exploration called the “ARX Project Lyobaa” has discovered a “vast underground labyrinth” underneath the 15th-century Church of San Pablo, all but confirming the Zapotec legend.\n",
      "The collaboration began at the archaeological site of the Zapotec city called Mitla, where murals, mosaics, and a monument stone palace are still seen above ground today.\n",
      "The researchers created a 3D model of Mitla’s subterranean passageways using a combination of three geophysical scanning technologies—ground penetrating radar, electrical resistivity tomography, and seismic noise tomography—all of which left the archaeological site above undisturbed.\n",
      "MORE MESOAMERICAN DISCOVERIES: Ancient Mayan City Hidden for Over 1,000 Years Discovered by LiDAR\n",
      "The model shows a very large hollow void underneath the precise location of the altar inside the church that was built on the Mitla site. Additionally, the void appears to be connected with another significant geophysical anomaly located immediately to the north of the church.\n",
      "“Burgoa’s account speaks of a vast subterranean temple consisting of four interconnected chambers, containing the tombs of the high priests and the kings of Teozapotlán,” reads a press release on the truly epic discovery.\n",
      "“From the last subterranean chamber, a stone door led into a deep cavern extending thirty leagues below ground. This cavern was intersected by other passages like streets, its roof supported by pillars.”\n",
      "The electrical tomography confirmed the existence of two passageways between 18 and 26 feet below the ground. They enter the void from the east. Their scanning also revealed what could be the barricaded entranceway Burgoa spoke of.\n",
      "The size and scope of the passageways surprised the researchers, who conclude that more work is needed before we can truly comprehend what has been found.\n",
      "“Additionally, the study has revealed evidence of an earlier construction stage of the Palace of the Columns, Mitla’s most important and best-preserved ancient monument, as well as several other geophysical anomalies that may be interpreted as tombs or buried archaeological structures,” the press release reads. “These findings will help rewrite the history of the origins of Mitla and its development as an ancient site.”\n",
      "Further studies of this kind are already scheduled for this September, meaning that the true scope of the mythical Lyobaa could be illuminated before the year is out.\n",

      "Defenders of former President Donald Trump have responded to news of his indictment by the US Department of Justice with deflection: Why is Trump being charged but not President Joe Biden’s son Hunter?\n",
      "“The two standards of justice under Biden’s DOJ is appalling. When will Hunter Biden be charged?” tweeted Rep. Steve Daines of Montana, who has already endorsed Trump’s 2024 campaign and who is in charge of coordinating Republicans’ strategy for keeping control of the House of Representatives.\n",
      "The facts, however, are much less clear.\n",
      "Fueling Republicans’ frustration this week is a standoff on Capitol Hill over a document detailing an interview conducted years ago based on a tip given to the DOJ by former Trump attorney Rudy Giuliani.\n",
      "Giuliani, you might recall, had been tasked with digging up dirt on the Bidens. House Republicans are convinced the interview with the confidential informant, based on Giuliani’s allegations, implicates both the president and his son.\n",
      "There’s an awkward circularity in there. Republicans are alleging the FBI under the Biden administration tried to cover up an investigation of a tip given to the FBI by Giuliani during the Trump administration, and which even Trump’s attorney general, William Barr, treated with extreme care.\n",
      "Here’s what to know:\n",
      "What do Republicans allege?\n",
      "That the FBI has been hiding evidence of a bribery allegation that could involve the president and his son receiving $5 million from someone with ties to Ukraine.\n",
      "Republicans say the evidence comes from an internal law enforcement document, known as an FD-1023, which details an interview conducted with a confidential informant.\n",
      "It is the one and only allegation that the president has been involved in something illegal. However, it is based on a tip the FBI has not been able to verify.\n",
      "What’s their basis for this allegation?\n",
      "Someone Republicans view as a whistleblower told lawmakers on Capitol Hill in May about the form detailing the interview and has alleged the FBI tried to bury it.\n",
      "Why didn’t the FBI want to hand over the document?\n",
      "It contains what the FBI calls “unverified” information.\n",
      "Essentially, anything could lead to an FD-1023 form, which does nothing more than acknowledge an interview took place.\n",
      "While Republicans are assuming there is a coverup, it does make some sense that if the FBI had gotten a wild claim that it could in no way substantiate, it would not want to give oxygen to that information.\n",
      "After all, much of Republicans’ gripe with the Russia investigation is that it stemmed from allegations about Trump that could not be verified. For more on that, read about the recently released report from special counsel John Durham, a Trump-administration appointee.\n",
      "Will lawmakers get to see the document?\n",
      "Yes. After House Oversight Committee Chairman James Comer threatened to hold FBI Director Christopher Wray in contempt of Congress, the FBI agreed to let all lawmakers on the committee view the FD-1023 form.\n",
      "Comer and the ranking Democrat, Rep. Jamie Raskin, had already been given access.\n",
      "After being given that access, Raskin said this whole affair is “part of the effort to smear President Biden and help Mr. Trump’s reelection campaign.”\n",
      "What are Republicans saying after seeing the document?\n",
      "After viewing the document, lawmakers confirmed the allegations have to do with Hunter Biden’s business dealings with Burisma, a Ukrainian gas company, and the document details conversations over a few years about the allegations and payments made.\n",
      "Members who viewed the document said the alleged payments to the Bidens are intentionally difficult to be traced.\n",
      "“If the information contained in this document is true, then there will be absolutely bank records to back it up. And that should be the next phase of the Oversight Committee is to go find and extract those bank records, go back and look at the suspicious activity reports,” said Rep. Nancy Mace of South Carolina.\n",
      "Republicans have an ongoing investigation into the finances of Hunter Biden and other Biden relatives. Read more about that.\n",
      "How long has the FBI had this document?\n",
      "For years. In fact, it dates back to the Trump administration.\n",
      "CNN’s Evan Perez has reported that the document has origins in a tranche of documents that Giuliani provided to the Justice Department in the run-up to the 2020 presidential election.\n",
      "What has the FBI been doing with the information from the informant?\n",
      "Barr, when he was Trump’s attorney general, directed then-Pittsburgh US Attorney Scott Brady to oversee the FBI investigation of the Giuliani claims.\n",
      "According to Perez’s reporting, Barr was worried the unsubstantiated claim could taint the work being done by the US attorney in Delaware who is overseeing a longtime and ongoing investigation of Hunter Biden on numerous fronts.\n",
      "Brady’s team interviewed the confidential informant on June 30, 2020, which generated the FD-1023. Barr recently told The Federalist the information was ultimately forwarded to the US attorney in Delaware.\n",
      "Republicans have questioned whether the US attorney there followed up on the allegations made in the interview.\n",
      "Will Hunter Biden be charged with a crime?\n",
      "It is definitely possible. Investigations into his business dealings with foreign clients, his failure to pay taxes on time and his purchase of a gun when he was addicted to drugs have all been ongoing. His attorneys met with officials in the Justice Department’s tax division in Washington, DC, in April.\n",
      "From CNN’s report at the time: According to sources familiar with the investigation, prosecutors are still weighing whether to bring two misdemeanor charges for failure to file taxes, one count of felony tax evasion related to the overreporting of expenses, and a false statement charge regarding a gun purchase.\n",
      "About Hunter Biden\n",
      "He has been a top target for Republican investigations for years on multiple fronts. His lifestyle as a drug addict trading on his father’s name to do business overseas is not a good reflection on his father. The money he and other Bidens made from foreign companies is just as uncomfortable for the president.\n",
      "There are other Hunter Biden-related threads. He has been ordered to appear next month in an Arkansas courtroom to explain why he should not be held in contempt for stonewalling attempts to obtain his financial data. He denies wrongdoing. The court proceedings are underway because his attorneys say he can no longer afford to pay $20,000 in monthly child support.\n",
      "But there’s a false equivalence between comparing his affairs, which still ultimately rely on unverified claims forwarded to the FBI by Giuliani, and Trump’s treatment of classified data, which the Department of Justice apparently feels confident it can prosecute.\n",

      "Writing in the Australian, Gideon Haigh felt England had learned from their mistakes in the first two Tests and this was a \"dismal way\" for the destiny of the Ashes to be decided.\n",

      "\"But if there is one anachronistic edict that must change, it's retaining a series simply because you've won it before.\n",
      "\"First, it gives the team that won the last series an unfair advantage, prompting the side to play defensive cricket.

It remains concerned that sending enough missiles to Ukraine would deplete the US's limited stock, weakening its response to other potential conflicts, officials told The Post.\n",
      "Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy is seeking hundreds of missiles from the US. \"Without long-range weapons, it is difficult not only to carry out an offensive mission but also to conduct a defensive operation,\" Zelensky said during a press conference earlier this month.\n",
      "Ukraine's forces, engaged in a counteroffensive, have been forced to advance slowly on foot in the face of dense Russian minefields and an area of landmines the size of Florida. Yesterday, Zelenskyy told the Aspen Security Forum that Ukraine's counteroffensive was poised to \"gain pace.\"\n",

      "The House Foreign Affairs Committee passed a resolution calling for ATACMS to \"immediately\" send the missiles to Ukraine earlier this month.\n",
      "But one official familiar with the issue told The Post that the US position remained firm despite the perception that there was \"some sort of slow, gravitational pull\" towards sending the missiles.\n",
      "The UK announced it sent Ukraine a number of Storm Shadow cruise missiles in May, which have a range of around 140 miles, according to The Post. The UK's Defence Minister Ben Wallace said the missiles were striking their targets with \"accuracy\" and \"almost without fault.\"\n",

      "\n",
      "Some people love it and some people hate it – but controversial video assistant refereeing (VAR) is present at the 2023 FIFA Women's World Cup.\n",
      "\n",
      "VAR refers to a team of people behind the scenes watching instant video replays of the action at multiple angles to gain insights that may have been missed by the referee.\n",
      "\n",
      "The VAR team advise the ref on key decisions, although opponents of the system argue that this often interrupts the flow of a match.\n",
      "\n",
      "For Australia and New Zealand 2023, there is a 19-member video refereeing team, which, for the first time, includes six women.\n",
      "\n",
      "But also this year there is a major update to how VAR decisions are relayed to the crowd.\n",
      "\n",
      "Taking its lead from the NFL, VAR decisions are being explained by the referee to spectators, for the first time at an international football tournament.\n",
      "\n",
      "When a decision is made based on info from the VAR team – such as overturning a red card or awarding a penalty – the ref speaks into a microphone to explain.\n",
      "\n",
      "Her voice is broadcast over the stadium's loudspeaker, letting people in the crowd and at home in front of their TVs know what's going on.\n",
      "\n",
      "Already, during New Zealand's opening match against Norway, the new system was used to award a penalty, which was subsequently missed by the co-hosts.\n",
      "\n",
      "Usually, VAR decisions are accompanied by descriptions on the stadium's big screens – but these tend to be very brief and can cause confusion.\n",
      "\n",
      "Speaking back in February, Pierluigi Collina, chairman of FIFA's referee committee, said: 'We decided to have this trial because we received some requests to make the decision taken by the referee after a VAR intervention more understandable for all.\n",

      "\n",
      "The technology tracks players' limbs to detect if they're in an offside position and sends an alert to the video assistant referee (VAR).\n",
      "\n",
      "So how does it work?\n",
      "\n",
      "All 10 stadiums at Australia and New Zealand 2023 have 12 cameras installed that collect data on up to 29 data points on every player's body 50 times per second.\n",
      "\n",
      "These data points spread from the tips of a player's feet, to their arms and the top of their head.\n",
      "\n",
      "Using footage from the cameras, AI tracks when exactly a pass was made and what position an attacking player was in, relative to the defending players.\n",
      "\n",
      "It determines if any part of the player was offside in half a second and then send an alert to the VAR operator, who can validate and confirm the information and notify the referee.\n",
      "\n",
      "Semi-automated offside technology is akin to goal-line technology, except that the cameras continuously track moving objects rather than the static goal line\n",
      "\n",
      "It was successfully used at the men's World Cup in Qatar last year and the FIFA Club World Cup final in February.\n",
      "\n",
      "For the first time at a Women's World Cup, the official football comes with smart 'connected ball technology'.\n",
      "\n",
      "The ball, called OCEAUNZ, has a sensor placed in its centre that provides 'unprecedented insight' into every element of the movement of the ball.\n",
      "\n",
      "Held aloft in the middle of the ball by a suspension system, the sensor sends data to the video operation room 500 times per second, allowing a precise detection of its location when kicked.\n",
      "\n",
      "The connected ball works in tandem with semi-automated offside technology to ensure that the position of the ball, as well as the players, can be accurately judged during crucial moments.\n",
      "\n",
      "It is also powered by a rechargeable battery that's charged by induction – the same type of wireless power transfer used for smartphones.\n",
      "\n",
      "OCEAUNZ also has a polyurethane skin with 'micro and macro textures' and a 20-piece panel exterior to enhance aerodynamics.\n",
      "\n",

      "The victims included three women — two were stabbed in the neck — and a man, all of whom are expected to survive, Montgomery County Police Assistant Chief Darren Francke told reporters during a Saturday afternoon news conference at the scene. Three were hospitalized with injuries.\n",
      "The suspect’s identity has not been released.\n",
      "Francke said the man used a 12-inch butcher knife in the stabbings, which started at a popular thrift store in Silver Spring, Maryland, and then continued in the surrounding neighborhood. While the investigation is ongoing, Francke said, detectives don’t believe the suspect knew any of the victims. He said the attacks appear “completely random.”\n",
      "“We have witnesses. We are continuing our interviews, but at this point it was an unprovoked attack,” he said.\n",
      "Police received reports around 10:35 a.m. of a stabbing at the thrift store. Almost simultaneously, another caller reported a second stabbing on a nearby street, according to police.\n",
      "The suspect ran into a wooded area while police started setting up a perimeter. Francke said the man then came out of the woods and “confronted a police cruiser.” He said another officer soon arrived on scene, saw the man armed with a knife, gave commands and ultimately opened fire, killing the suspect.\n",
      "“The officer fired multiple rounds and the subject was stopped from attacking further people,” Francke said.\n",
      "The suspect died at the scene.\n",
      "The Maryland Attorney General’s Office is investigating the police shooting, which is standard procedure under state law. That office will turn over the results of its investigation to local prosecutors, who will decide whether the officer could face criminal charges.\n",

      "WASHINGTON (AP) — Lawmakers intent on reducing China ‘s influence on the U.S. economy are pushing the Treasury Department to help curb the outsized role of Beijing at the Inter-American Development Bank, which supports economic and social development in Latin America and Caribbean.\n",
      "The bipartisan group of lawmakers say Beijing is using the bank as a tool to expand its influence in the region. And they want the U.S., the biggest voice at the bank, to do more to rein in the awarding of projects to Chinese firms and to block Chinese attempts to acquire more shares at the bank.\n",
      "Rep. Mike Gallagher, the Republican chairman of a new House select committee focused on China, is the lead sponsor of of the legislation, which is being introduced Tuesday, seeking to understand and reduce Beijing’s power at the bank.\n",
      "The Inter-American Development Bank Transparency Act would require the Treasury to issue a report every two years on the scope and scale of Chinese influence and involvement in all aspects of the bank, including a list of Chinese-funded projects and an action plan for the U.S. to reduce Chinese involvement at the bank.\n",
      "READ MORE: China-U.S. ties at a crossroads but could possibly stabilize, Xi tells Kissinger\n",
      "“For too long, the Chinese Communist Party has exploited its presence in the Inter-American Development Bank to advance its own geopolitical, economic, and technological goals,” Gallagher said in a statement. “Latin American citizens deserve to have the IDB serve their economic development, not as a vector of CCP malign influence.”\n",
      "The IDB is a non-commercial development bank made up of member countries. The bank, for instance, disbursed a record $23 billion last year intended to alleviate poverty made worse by the coronavirus pandemic in the region. The U.S. is the largest shareholder, with a roughly 30 percent voting share. At issue is the number of contracts the IDB awards to Chinese firms relative to its meager share of the bank, which hovers around 0.1 percent.\n",
      "China formally joined the bank in 2009 as its 48th member nation, and its influence in Latin America, both economically and diplomatically, has grown exponentially in the past two decades.\n",
      "In 2022, Latin American and Caribbean trade with China rose to record levels, exporting roughly $184 billion to China and importing an estimated $265 billion in goods, according to a Boston University Global Development Policy Center analysis.\n",
      "More than a dozen Republican and Democratic lawmakers have signed on with Gallagher as co-sponsors of the legislation, including Sen. Robert Menendez, the Democratic chairman of the Senate Committee on Foreign Relations.\n",
      "It’s seen as a first step at addressing China’s influence over the multilateral development banks. And while the Biden administration already has the authority to do much of what lawmakers are seeking, the legislation is intended to force the issue.\n",
      "READ MORE: Blinken heads to Tonga, New Zealand, Australia as U.S. aims to counter China’s influence in the region\n",
      "Menendez said in a statement that “as China continues to use economic tools to advance its coercive economic agenda across the Western Hemisphere, it’s more important than ever that we protect the integrity of the IDB and ensure its critical work can continue unhampered by Beijing’s interference.”\n",
      "Diplomatic relations between Latin American and China have also increased. In March, Honduras cut diplomatic ties with Taiwan in favor of China, following the steps of El Salvador, Nicaragua, Panama and the Dominican Republic in turning their backs on Taiwan.\n",
      "Enrique Dussel Peters, a professor and coordinator of the Center for Chinese-Mexican Studies at Universidad Nacional Autónoma de México, said the U.S. effort to compete with China in Latin America “comes 20 years too late.”\n",
      "“In many cases in many countries such as Brazil, Argentina, Chile, Peru,” he said, “China is already the most important trading partner and it has become a very dynamic investor in these countries, from lithium to raw materials to oil to gas to whatever issue you can image.”\n",
      "Other development banks have also been scrutinized for possible undue influence by the Chinese.\n",
      "In 2021 IMF Managing Director Kristalina Georgieva came under fire after allegations that while she was a World Bank official, she and others pressured staffers to change business rankings in an effort to placate China. The IMF’s 24-member executive board reviewed Georgieva’s actions and concluded that she “did not conclusively demonstrate” an improper role.\n",
      "The House formed the new China committee in January to focus on improving U.S. competitiveness with China economically and militarily. The committee’s early work has included investigations into partnerships that American companies and universities have entered into with Chinese entities as lawmakers take a harder look at efforts that could benefit Beijing at the long-term expense of the U.S.\n",

      "- Other European countries are pursuing their own rocket artillery, buying HIMARS or building new systems.\n",
      "Impressed with the success of the US-made M142 HIMARS multiple rocket launcher in Ukraine, more European nations want to buy HIMARS — or develop their own version of it.\n",
      "German defense contractor Rheinmetall and US defense firm Lockheed Martin have partnered to offer GMARS, a replacement for Germany's aging MARS 2 multiple launch rocket system, according to Defense News.\n",
      "The acronym \"GMARS\" seems to reflect HIMARS as much as MARS 2, of which Germany has delivered several to Ukraine. MARS 2 is the European version of the US-made M270 multiple launch rocket system.\n",
      "GMARS would be similar to HIMARS but bigger, with a larger chassis based on Rheinmetall's HX 8x8 truck, and would have 80% commonality with HIMARS munitions and logistics, a Lockheed Martin official told Defense News. The GMARS vehicle would be about 39 feet long vs. the 23-foot length of a HIMARS truck and carry two rocket pods instead of HIMARS' one.\n",
      "Meanwhile, the US State Department approved a $10 billion sale of 18 HIMARS for Poland in February. Significantly, the sale includes 45 M57 Army Tactical Missile Systems — long-range guided rockets that Ukraine has repeatedly requested but which the US has declined to provide for fear of escalating the conflict.\n",
      "HIMARS will help Poland \"deter regional threats,\" the department said in an announcement. \"The proposed sale of this equipment and support will not alter the basic military balance in the region.\"\n",
      "HIMARS has a range of about 50 miles. An ATACMS projectile can reach up to 190 miles and can be fired from a HIMARS launcher, though that feature reportedly has been disabled in HIMARS systems supplied to Ukraine.\n",
      "The Biden administration is now debating whether to send ATACMS to Ukraine after the UK gave Ukraine its Storm Shadow missile, which has a range of more than 150 miles. (France is also sending its version of the missile.)\n",
      "Multiple launch rocket systems have been around since World War II, when the legendary Soviet Katyusha battered Nazi forces.\n",
      "Until the 1980s, the US and its allies favored howitzers rather than MLRS, which were considered inaccurate weapons suited for firing over a large area. For the Soviets, who preferred massed firepower, and for dictators and warlords unconcerned about collateral damage, rockets were just fine.\n",
      "But rocket artillery has changed. A new generation of GPS-guided rockets, such as HIMARS and Russia's Smerch and Tornado-S systems, combine the accuracy of a howitzer with the range of a rocket and have the ability to fire salvoes quickly. What was once a blunt-force weapon that pulverized city blocks and the civilians living there is now a smart weapon.\n",
      "That \"smartness\" explains the buzz around modern MLRS at least as much as their actual military effectiveness, which is often overstated.\n",
      "HIMARS initially proved devastating against Russian forces that placed their command posts and ammunitions dumps too close to the front line. But Russia adapted and moved its command and supply centers out of HIMARS range, though at the price of compromising some efficiency.\n",
      "Russian GPS jammers have also hampered HIMARS and the Joint Direct Attack Munition glide bombs that the US has given Ukraine.\n",
      "Rocket artillery can't replace howitzers, which offer some advantages, such as the ability to fire barrages continuously for hours. Still, rocket artillery is certain to join howitzers as the backbone of Western artillery.\n",
      "Modern MLRS rockets have greater range than howitzer shells — although long-range rocket-propelled howitzer shells are being developed — and in an era when battlefield footage is spread wide, far, and fast, there will always be something impressive about the fiery trail of a rocket heading toward its target.\n",

      "Original Article : Police in South Carolina are investigating whether Gilgo Beach murder suspect Rex Heuermann may have been involved in the 2014 disappearance of a teenager, authorities confirmed to ABC News on Thursday.\n",
      "In November 2014, 18-year-old Aaliyah Bell vanished in Rock Hill, about 20 miles from the vacant lots associated with Heuermann that police had been searching in connection with the Gilgo Beach case.\n",
      "\"Our investigators have been reviewing any information to see if there is a correlation between the disappearance of Aaliyah Bell and Rex Heuermann,\" Rock Hill Lt. Michael Chavis said in an email to ABC News. \"So far there is no indication that leads us to identify Heuermann as a suspect in this case. We will continue to investigate Bell's disappearance and follow up on all tips and leads.\"\n",
      "Unsolved murders and missing persons cases \"around the nation\" are getting a second look a week after Heuermann's arrest for the murders of three young women whose burlap-wrapped bodies were found along Gilgo Beach, Suffolk County Police Commissioner Rodney Harrison said.\n",
      "Among those cases getting a second look are the 2006 killings of four women working as prostitutes in Atlantic City. Their bodies were found in a watery ditch along Black Horse Pike in Egg Harbor Township, New Jersey.\n",
      "Police in Las Vegas, where Heuermann owned a timeshare, said this week they are also looking at possible connections to unsolved cases.\n",
      "\"We are working with partner law enforcement agencies, obviously the FBI continues to be engaged, to see if there are any other connections that need to be made,\" Suffolk County Executive Steve Bellone told New York ABC station WABC on Thursday. \"I can tell you this: the investigation continues. We will remain and our police department will remain focused on bringing justice for our other victims.\"\n",
      "Evidence technicians were scouring Heuermann's Massapequa Park home for a seventh consecutive day on Thursday. The search of the house is expected to last at least another three days, a law enforcement official familiar with the search told ABC News.\n",
      "Heuermann was arrested on July 13 in connection with three of the 10 victims linked to the Gilgo Beach murders. The 59-year-old father of two was charged with the murders of Melissa Barthelemy, Megan Waterman and Amber Costello, whose bodies were found along Ocean Parkway on Long Island's South Shore in December 2010, according to court records unsealed last week in Suffolk County Criminal Court.\n",
      "Barthelemy disappeared in July 2009, Waterman disappeared in June 2010 and Costello was last seen in September 2010. The three women were between 22 and 27 years old and all worked as sex workers, court records said.\n",
      "A fourth victim, Maureen Brainard-Barnes, who vanished in July 2007, was also tied to the three women. While Heuermann is not charged in the death of Brainard-Barnes, the court documents said he is the \"prime suspect in her death.\" The investigation into Brainard-Barnes' death is ongoing, officials said last week.\n",

      "Sen. Lisa Murkowksi (R-Alaska) said Thursday if the 2024 presidential matchup is between President Biden and former President Trump, she would go with Sen. Joe Manchin (D-W.Va.), who so far has not launched a presidential bid.\n",
      "“If it’s a matchup between Biden and Trump, I know exactly where I’d go. I would go with Joe Manchin,” Murkowski said in an interview with PBS’s Margaret Hoover on “Firing Line.” “I am one who doesn’t like to use my vote for the lesser of two evils. I want to be proactive in who I think could do the job.”\n",
      "Murkowski said people are hungry for an independent or someone who’s “offering something in the middle,” noting she is “very close” with Manchin.\n",
      "Manchin appeared earlier this week at a town hall in New Hampshire that was sponsored by political organization No Labels, sparking conversation of a possible third-party bid for the West Virginia senator.\n",
      "Some Democratic senators have expressed concern a third-party presidential run could take votes away from Biden and boost Trump.\n",
      "“I have no qualms, no qualms providing my endorsement to a Democrat who I think has been not only extraordinarily helpful to me and Alaskan issues, but in the Senate as well,” Murkowski said, pointing to her and Manchin’s past endorsements of one another.\n",
      "The Alaska senator said her constituents have asked her to talk Manchin into running, to which she said, “That’s not for me to do.” She said she does think about what a third party could “bring to the equation.”\n",
      "“If we go into a 2024 scenario, where it’s basically a redo of 2020 between Trump and Biden, what does that say? That we have nobody better than these two?” Murkowski said.\n",
      "Manchin is also up for reelection in 2024, meaning his key Senate seat and potentially the majority in the chamber could go to the GOP if he runs for president instead.\n",

      "Original Article : Just one month ago, the world had no idea what to expect from HBO’s The Idol—only that it starred The Weeknd and Lily-Rose Depp, and that people were mad at it. Were we ever so young? The Sam Levinson-created series has been courting controversy—both of the marketing-generated and unintentional varieties—ever since. Yet somehow, it’s reached its penultimate episode without fully justifying what all the noise was even for. Despite regular exposition and backstory dumps, a lot of questions about the series and its musical sex cult remain. With next week’s finale imminent, here are the most pressing queries The Idol has yet to address.\n",
      "Several key people in Jocelyn’s orbit have been largely MIA since the premiere. Where did Dan Levy go? Or Eli Roth? Or even Hari Nef, whose Vanity Fair reporter only appeared as a floating Zoom head while interviewing Jocelyn in the show’s latest episode? For a series with only five episodes total, The Idol sure knows how to shed cast members. Speaking of which: who were the actors presumably ousted after the show’s change in creative direction, including Elizabeth Berkley and the late Anne Heche, meant to play?\n",
      "Will we ever see the Rolling Stone scene that The Weeknd posted in response to an actual exposé about alleged behind-the-scenes issues on the HBO show? Perhaps that VF piece doesn’t go so well for Jocelyn, prompting her team to pursue another publication?\n",
      "What more is there to discover about Tedros’s controversial hairstyle? As The Weeknd warned GQ earlier this month: “You’ll find out more about the rattail later on.” The time has come—where are our answers?!\n",
      "While on the subject of Tedros: who is running the nightclub he operated his cult out of before migrating to Jocelyn’s megamansion?\n",
      "And what, exactly, comes of the “record deals” Tedro makes with his musical followers? Do they perform exclusively at his unnamed club? And how would Tedros, who appears to have no real standing in the music industry, know actual producer Mike Dean, who has worked with the likes of Beyoncé and Madonna?\n",
      "Who is responsible for all of the security at Jocelyn’s mansion? Save for one quick shot of highly-armed men on the perimeters of her property, we hear no explanation of how they got there—or if they were always there. Also of note: what is it like to work for Jocelyn, a job description that seems to include ripping dildos off walls and scooping cocaine back into baggies? Perhaps the personal chef who was unceremoniously fired in episode three is priming a tell-all?\n",
      "And the intimacy coordinator who was trapped in a closet for several hours in the premiere is headed straight to DeuxMoi, right?\n",
      "Jocelyn and Leia’s (Rachel Sennott) makeup line, Half Magic, sounds familiar. Is it real? (It is, in fact, the name of the Euphoria makeup team’s actual products.)\n",
      "What is up with Hank Azaria’s accent? Does he using while defending The Idol against controversy?\n",
      "Although all of Jocelyn’s inner circle is being dismantled by Tedros, her childhood friend-turned-creative director is receiving the brunt of the abuse. But why is Xander (Troye Sivan) to blame? Jocelyn alleges that he silenced her about her mother’s physical abuse; Xander claims that Jocelyn’s mother forced him to sign a Little Mermaid-esque contract forcing him to never sing publicly. But who is telling the truth about their dynamic?\n",
      "And what’s Chloe’s (Suzanna Son) deal? The happy-go-lucky, piano-playing cult member who is most definitely underage could be the key to exposing Tedros. At one point, Jocelyn’s manager Destiny (Da’Vine Joy Randolph) advises Chloe to “stay observant—if it feels wrong, it’s wrong.” It’s unclear what she’ll do with that tip.\n",
      "Who leaked Jocelyn’s NSFW photo? It could be her newly-reintroduced actor ex-boyfriend Rob (Karl Glusman) or Jocelyn herself if she’s as manipulative as some have claimed. But will we find out either way?\n",
      "Who is Sophie? At one point in the show’s latest episode, a bikini-clad woman introduced by Xander as his “best friend” sits atop Rob’s lap for an increasingly intimate photo for a reason that has yet to be revealed. So… what was up with that?\n",
      "How much of Jocelyn’s “new sound” will we get to hear? So far, the show has played us “World-Class Sinner,” the single now in the hands of Jennie Kim’s Dyanne, in various sexed-up iterations. But could a concert sequence showcasing the new songs be coming, as suggested by footage of Depp performing in character at The Weeknd’s shows?\n",
      "And finally, will someone die? “I think we should kill this motherfucker,” Destiny not-so-jokingly suggests in response to Tedros’s invasion of Jocelyn’s life. But will anyone actually follow through, as the first episode hints?\n",

      "Original Article : PORT OF SPAIN, Trinidad (AP) — West Indies stubbornly fought to avoid the follow-on against India on a snail-paced third day of the second test at Queen's Park Oval on Saturday.\n",
      "After scoring at barely two runs per over, West Indies doggedly reached stumps on 229-4 in reply to India's 438. West Indies need only 10 more runs to make India bat again.\n",
      "The first test in Dominica ended in three days and the West Indies was embarrassed by a heavy innings defeat. In Trinidad, the home side has dug in to grind out a draw against a team it hasn't beaten in 21 years.\n",
      "Captain Kraigg Brathwaite has set the tone. The opener started on Friday and not until after lunch on Saturday did he reach his fifty off 170 balls, the second slowest of his career.\n",
      "West Indies' determination to take its time, block or leave, netted only 143 runs in 67 overs, 33 of which were maidens. Two hours were lost to rain delays and play ended 20 minutes early because of bad light.\n",
      "India's spinners have remarkable figures. Ravichandran Ashwin, who hauled in 12 wickets in Dominica, has 1-61 from 33 overs. Ravindra Jadeja has 2-37 from 25 overs.\n",
      "Brathwaite started the day with new cap Kirk McKenzie, who took three boundaries off Jaydev Unadkat and gave medium-pacer Mukesh Kumar his maiden test wicket after taking a cut on 32.\n",
      "As soon as McKenzie was out, rain arrived to delay the game for an hour.\n",
      "After lunch, Kumar was pulled over fine leg for a six by Brathwaite, then the captain was out for 75 after facing 235 deliveries. He was drawn forward by Ashwin, whose ball turned in and took out middle stump.\n",
      "After a period in which West Indies scored 20 runs in 15 overs, Alick Athanaze hit successive fours off Ashwin and he and Jermaine Blackwood survived India reviews.\n",
      "Blackwood, on 20 from 92 balls, was out straight after tea, deflecting Jadeja to Ajinkya Rahane, who made a one-handed catch in the cordon.\n",
      "Joshua Da Silva was bowled on 10 trying to drive Mohammed Siraj, right before another rain delay of nearly an hour.\n",
      "India finally took the new ball in the 103rd over, but Athanaze and Jason Holder remained untroubled to stumps. Athanaze was on 37 from 111 balls and Holder on 11.\n",

      "Democrats are embracing Bidenomics. Both parties say that’s a good thing.\n",
      "As President Joe Biden steers toward his re-election campaign with a tour promoting his economic record, congressional Democrats are pointing to cooling inflation, low unemployment, a cap on insulin prices, and a steady roll-out of infrastructure projects as evidence that their agenda has delivered benefits for everyday Americans — and will continue doing so as next year’s races for the White House and Congress unfold.\n",
      "“You can call it Bidenomics, you can call it significant progress. I think what the middle class wants to see is that these are policies that are working,” said Rep. Pete Aguilar (D-Calif.), the third-ranking Democrat in the House. “Over 13 million jobs created by the Biden-Harris administration, record (low) unemployment numbers, inflation lowering months and months in a row. These are positive, strong signs to growing the middle class from the middle out and the ground up.”\n",
      "The problem for Aguilar, Biden, and battleground Democrats facing tough re-elections: Polls suggest that after three years of high inflation, most voters aren’t sold on Bidenomics.\n",
      "“I hope he keeps it up. It’ll be good for the campaign,” said Rep. Tom Emmer (R-Minn.), the Republican whip.\n",
      "“The American public does not agree that this is a much better economy,” Emmer said. “They’re not buying it. And they shouldn’t, people are struggling at home.”\n",
      "Senate Republicans asked about “Bidenomics” immediately quoted the president’s polling average on the issue, as compiled by the web site Real Clear Politics: fewer than 39% of voters approve of his work on the issue.\n",
      "“It’s amusing that he’s stuck his name on the policy and he’s not that popular himself, even among Democrats,” said Sen. John Cornyn (R-Texas).\n",
      "Democrats countered daunting polling by arguing that voters will increasingly see the upside of their work as time goes on, and they hope, lower inflation becomes normal again. Democrats are planning to highlight those results with events built around groundbreakings for roads and bridges, broadband expansion, and other projects over the coming August recess and throughout the 2024 cycle.\n",
      "“Not all of it you can feel right away,” said Rep. Susan Wild (D-Pa.), who represents one of the country’s most closely divided districts. “But I do think Bidenomics is exactly what he should be talking about.”\n",
      "‘Tangible things people can see’\n",
      "Biden has emphasized the economy as a triumph of his first term, an effort he continued Thursday when he spoke at a shipyard in Philadelphia. In a state that’s crucial to control of the presidency, Senate, and House, Biden promoted an offshore wind project vessel to be built by more than 1,000 workers, with steel plates made in Indiana, and which the White House pointed to as an example of the benefits of his administration’s investments in clean energy.\n",
      "Biden might not have much choice but to talk about the economy. The issue consistently ranks as voters’ top concern, and no president can run away from economic conditions on their watch — no matter how much, or little, they did to shape the results.\n",
      "While other issues will also factor into the outcome of the 2024 campaign, including individual candidate quality and debates over abortion, crime, health care, and border security, Democrats in tough races predicted that the economic news this year and next will be increasingly positive.\n",
      "“There’s a powerful story to tell about the impact he’s made since he’s been president and that our Democratic Senate has contributed to,” said Sen. Tammy Baldwin (D-Wis.), who’s seeking re-election in a Midwestern battleground.\n",
      "The most recent data has shown the lowest inflation rate in more than two years. Unemployment remains low. Wages have started growing faster than costs. Some analysts are downgrading the chances of a recession. The stock market has surged. And Democrats say the public is only beginning to absorb the results of their work.\n",
      "Baldwin and other Democrats pointed to the infrastructure projects, a $35 insulin price cap, and investments in green energy and semiconductor manufacturing spurred by laws they passed — sometimes with GOP support, sometimes without.\n",
      "“There’s more positive change yet to come,” Baldwin said. “There are the things that are highly visible — the roads being built, the bridges being secured, the relief people feel when they know that when they turn on their faucet, there’s not going to be lead … There are some very tangible things that people can see.”\n",
      "Democrats believe when voters are given a choice between Biden and the GOP, they’ll reject Republicans who, under former President Donald Trump, passed a tax package weighted toward the wealthy, and whose right wing recently threatened the country with a default by resisting an increase in the federal debt ceiling.\n",
      "“There is a real lack of understanding between the GOP and the, you know, people who work for a living across this country,” said Rep. Mikie Sherrill (D-N.J.).\n",
      "Reminding voters about prices\n",
      "Republicans say it’s Democrats who don’t understand.\n",
      "“They are trying to memory-hole the last three years of the president’s term, the economic pain they’ve inflicted on everyone in America,” said Jack Pandol, communications director for the National Republican Congressional Committee, the House GOP’s campaign arm.\n",
      "Some 62% of American adults disapprove of Biden’s handling of inflation, according to a Monmouth University poll released this week. There was a nearly even split when it came to his work on jobs.\n",
      "Biden has been shadowed throughout his presidency by inflation, which took off early in his term and, despite pronouncements that it was a short-term problem, proved persistent. While rising prices have been a global phenomenon, and economists vary on how much of the US price spikes can be chalked up to government spending as opposed to wider economic factors after the pandemic, most believe the vast programs rolled out by Biden, and Trump before him, at least contributed to the problem.\n",
      "Democrats argue that their bills were a necessary bridge after the pandemic, and that inflation was better than an anemic recovery. But Republicans say the spending was excessive, and came after the worst of the emergency had passed.\n",
      "“Republicans are going to be reminding voters of high grocery costs, high gas prices, the things that have taken a bite out of family budgets, and reminding people who is responsible for that,” Pandol said.\n",
      "A changing election environment\n",
      "Democrats faced an even more difficult political environment last year, when inflation was running much hotter, and they still fared far better in that election than most analysts expected. This year, they’re hoping that good economic news puts the wind at their backs. Though given the unpredictability of the economy, it’s also possible the opposite happens: That a downturn inflicts economic pain just before voters weigh in on Biden’s leadership.\n",
      "Republicans say they’re not wishing for that. But they’ll point to Bidenomics if it does.\n",
      "“We’re all hoping for a soft landing, but that’s by no means assured,” Cornyn said. “We could well be in a recession at some point in the not too distant future. I hope that’s not true, but I don’t think the American people are particularly pleased with President Biden’s handling of the economy.”\n",

      "The Justice Department's Inspector General report details the failures that occurred beginning one month before the disgraced financier's death in Bureau of Prisons custody.\n",
      "When officers discovered Epstein unresponsive in his cell on Aug. 10, 2019, Officer Michael Thomas, who was charged criminally in the case, said, \"Breathe, Epstein, Breathe,\" according to the report.\n",
      "When Thomas saw Epstein dangling from the bed, he said, \"We're going to be in a lot of trouble,\" according to the report.\n",
      "When Epstein's room was searched after his death, investigators found extra bedsheets, another mattress and a noose, according to the report.\n",
      "Epstein died by hanging at Manhattan's Metropolitan Correctional Center while he was awaiting trial on federal sex trafficking charges.\n",
      "On Aug. 10, the Inspector General said Epstein was in his cell at 8 p.m. Officials said he made an unrecorded call on a landline that was not monitored by prison communications. Epstein told the officers he was calling his mother, according to the report, but she had died before that date. The report said staffers should have been monitoring this call made by Epstein.\n",
      "After 10:40 p.m., Epstein was not checked on nor was he monitored until officers discovered him hanging from his cell, according to the report.\n",
      "Epstein first attempted suicide in custody on July 23, 2019, and the Inspector General report said Bureau of Prisons employees should have been put on alert then.\n",
      "On July 30, the Inspector General said an email was sent to 70 staffers of the prison physiological unit instructing that Epstein was to be housed with a cellmate. But the Inspector General said that warning went unheeded by Bureau of Prisons staff.\n",
      "The report is coupled with nearly 4,000 pages of documents obtained by reporters earlier this month under a Freedom of Information Act request.\n",
      "The documents show that toward the end of his life, Epstein sat alone in his cell at the Metropolitan Correctional Center, repeatedly calling himself a coward out loud.\n",
      "Thomas and his partner were charged with doctoring the log books to make it seem like they completed their rounds when they had not, according to officials. Both pleaded guilty.\n",

      "City officials said the former president’s Make America Great Again rally ran up a $35,129 tab while passing through town for an Oct. 10, 2018, rally at Erie Insurance Arena. That bill for overtime pay for city workers including law enforcement officers was footed by taxpayer money.\n",
      "Trump plans to return to the scene of the proverbial crime at 6 p.m. Saturday following an afternoon of events at that same venue. City officials said they have no control over the arena, but plan to bill his campaign in advance for the services an event like this requires.\n",

Dramatic music plays in the background as a black-and-white photo of Trump zooms out and his 2024 campaign logo appears. While the audio itself is from a 2020 conversation about Iran, the message seems to target special counsel Jack Smith, one of Trump’s current biggest foes. Earlier this week, Trump lost his mind after prosecutors warned him that he is the target of another criminal investigation. On Truth Social, Trump declared it was “HORRIFYING NEWS for our Country” and labeled Smith as “deranged.\n",

      "Original Article : The stars are all over this year’s Toronto International Film Festival lineup—but that’s to be expected. The real surprise here is that, in a bit of a twist, they’ll likely be able to appear in Canada, despite ongoing SAG-AFTRA strike rules that largely prohibit promotional appearances at film festivals. Why? A whole bunch of those stars also happen to be filmmakers.\n",
      "This year’s preliminary TIFF lineup, released Monday, includes films directed by the likes of Tony Goldwyn (Ezra), Michael Keaton (Knox Goes Away), Kristin Scott Thomas (North Star), Chris Pine (Poolman), Viggo Mortensen (The Dead Don’t Hurt), Ethan Hawke (Wildcat), and Anna Kendrick (Woman of the Hour). What’s more, these are all sales titles, meaning they’re not beholden to a studio (and thus, the AMPTP) yet. It’s great, necessary timing for the fall-festival community, which is reeling from studio pullbacks in the wake of the dual SAG and WGA strikes.\n",
      "That said, TIFF still appears to be playing its usual role of awards-season central station. Each year, TIFF immediately follows the overlapping Venice and Telluride festivals, presenting films that previously premiered at those events. Indeed, the most newsworthy part of this lineup may be the number of Telluride debuts we can infer, based on premieres that have been labeled “Canadian” or “International” debuts rather than “worldwide” debuts. (Telluride does not announce its lineup until just before Labor Day Weekend.) Netflix’s Nyad and Rustin, which feature already buzzy performances from Annette Bening and Colman Domingo, respectively, both appear to be going that route, as does Focus’s The Holdovers—which reunites Sideways director Alexander Payne and star Paul Giamatti—and Apple’s Fingernails, whose killer cast includes Jessie Buckley, Riz Ahmed, and Jeremy Allen White.\n",
      "Toronto will also bring in the top prize winners from Cannes, Neon’s Anatomy of a Fall and A24’s The Zone of Interest—both of which star German actress Sandra Hüller, presumably not bound by SAG-AFTRA rules—as well as a few Sundance successes like Netflix’s Fair Play. Several sales titles beyond those aforementioned celeb-directed ones could also catch fire as late-season contenders, if they play well. Kate Winslet portrays war photographer Lee Miller in the biopic Lee, from Ellen Kuras, while Jessica Chastain top-lines Michel Franco’s Memory.\n",
      "Notably, while the list is littered with implicit Telluride debuts—Anatomy of a Fall can also be counted on showing up at the earlier fest—the list is much smaller, among notable titles, when it comes to presumed Venice launches. (One seeming exception is Richard Linklater’s Hitman.) Venice recently lost its opening film, Luca Guadagnino’s Challengers (which is moving to a 2024 release), due to the ongoing strikes; we’ll have to see whether the typically starry fest has been further affected by postponed titles when it announces its lineup on Tuesday. Major fall films yet to secure a festival announcement include Bradley Cooper’s Maestro, Ridley Scott’s Napoleon, Emerald Fennell’s Saltburn, and David Fincher’s The Killer; according to the lineup, none of these four are debuting at TIFF. We’ll soon know whether more of their rollouts have changed for them, or if Toronto simply wasn’t in the cards for these films.\n",

      "Original Article : Constitutional law professor Jonathan Turley slammed Minnesota Democrat Attorney General Keith Ellison for comparing Supreme Court Justice Clarence Thomas to a house slave character from a Quentin Tarantino movie, and called out Democrats for not condemning the comment.\n",
      "\"The bitter irony is that Thomas is the antithesis of the Stephen character referenced by AG Ellison in this latest racist attack,\" Turley, a Fox News contributor, tweeted on Wednesday morning.\n",
      "Turley’s tweet linked to an article on his blog with the title, \"The Django Syndrome: What The Latest Racist Attacks on Clarence Thomas Say About Our Rage Politics.\"\n",
      "\"Thomas has always refused to yield to the demands of others on how he should think as a jurist due to his race. Keith Ellison has long valued intimidation as a political weapon,\" the tweet added. \"He previously praised the ultra-violent group Antifa as useful to ‘strike fear in the heart’ of Trump and Republicans. Of course, Django is all about righteous rage as a license for the most extreme actions.\"\n",
      "This week, Ellison lashed out at Thomas over his position in the 6-3 ruling against affirmative action and compared him to the \"house slave\" character in Quentin Tarantino’s 2012 Western action film \"Django Unchained.\"\n",
      "\"Anybody who’s watched the movie ‘Django,’ just watch Stephen and you see Clarence Thomas,\" Ellison said.\n",
      "\"Clarence Thomas has decided that his best personal interest is siding with the powerful and the special interests regardless as to who they’re going to hurt. He's like, I'm looking out for me, and I don't care nothing about you, but I'm on the Supreme Court so it's my job to look out for you.’ So he's abdicating his responsibility. He has abdicated it a long time ago. When he got in office, he was this way. He's this way now, maybe he's worse now.\"\n",
      "In his article, Turley called out the lack of concern from a \"single Democrat\" about the \"openly racist attack\" against Thomas and specifically mentioned the silence from Minnesota Democrats Sen. Amy Klobuchar and Gov. Tim Walz who have both openly denounced rhetoric they have deemed racist from the other side.\n",
      "Turley also pointed out the relative silence from the media on the current issue as well as historically as it relates to racist attacks against Thomas, which he said occurred since the day he was nominated to the bench in 1991.\n",
      "\"The media has been unrelenting in its hostile and one-sided coverage of Thomas,\" wrote Turley, the Shapiro Professor of Public Interest Law at George Washington University. \"While running gushing pieces heralding the backgrounds of liberal justices, there has been a virtual news blackout on Thomas’ amazing life story, one of the truly most inspirational accounts of overcoming every possible obstacle in life.\"\n",
      "\"The silence of figures in academia, the media, and politics is deafening,\" Turley told Fox News Digital in a statement on Wednesday. \"Even when faced with raw racist attacks against Thomas, few want to be seen as defending the jurist. He remains a figure for cathartic rage on the left, untethered by principles of decency or consistency.\"\n",
      "In recent months, Thomas has faced intense scrutiny from the left regarding his travel habits and friendship with a billionaire Republican donor which a government compliance expert told Fox News Digital in April amounts to \"politics plain and simple.\"\n",
      "Ellison's office did not immediately respond to a request for comment from Fox News Digital.\n",

      "NewsNation’s Dan Abrams asked Richard Donoghue, who served in Trump’s Justice Department from December 2020 to January 2021, what he thought of remarks made by Speaker Kevin McCarthy (R-Calif.) Tuesday accusing President Biden of weaponizing the government to go after his opponent.\n",
      "“I think nothing could be further from the truth,” Donoghue said. “For some people, Donald Trump will always be a man who was targeted because he stands up to corrupt elites, and for others he will always be Benedict Donald, a leader who puts his own interests above the country’s.”\n",
      "“I don’t think he’s political. He’s not left-wing, he is not an agent of the deep state,” he said said of Smith. “His politics would put him right of center, I believe, and look, he secured the first capital sentence in New York in more than 50 years. He’s not a bleeding heart liberal.”\n",
      "Abrams asked Donoghue if he believed it was unfair for those to describe Smith as a “tool of the left wing.”\n",
      "“Absolutely, I don’t believe that for a minute,” he said. “I’ve known Jack for decades. I’ve seen and worked many, many cases over the years up close. I’ve seen him work incredibly hard at doing that and what he’s always done is follow the facts and apply the law.”\n",
      "Trump revealed Tuesday that he received a letter informing him that he is a target of Smith’s investigation looking into the Jan. 6, 2021, attacks on the Capitol and efforts to overturn the 2020 election. Legal experts say that means the former president will likely be indicted for a third time this year.\n",

      "Murphy said New Jersey filed the lawsuit against the Department of Transportation (DOT) and Federal Highway Administration (FHWA), and accused the federal agencies of violating environmental laws. In May, the FHWA authorized a plan from New York's Metropolitan Transportation Authority (MTA) to charge commuters an increased fee to enter Manhattan in an effort to reduce congestion and improve the city's air quality.\n",
      "\"After refusing to conduct a full environmental review of the MTA’s poorly designed tolling program, the FHWA has unlawfully fast-tracked the agency’s attempt to line its own coffers at the expense of New Jersey families,\" Murphy said Friday in a statement. \"The costs of standing idly by while the MTA uses New Jersey residents to help balance its budget sheets are more than economic.\"\n",
      "\"At the MTA’s own admission, its tolling program would divert traffic and shift pollution to many vulnerable New Jersey communities, impacting air quality while offering nothing to mitigate such considerable harm,\" he added. \"Today we stand as a unified front against this reckless scheme and reaffirm our commitment to combat the unjust taxation of our hardworking residents by other states.\"\n",
      "After the plan received federal approval in May, Murphy said it also violated President Biden's own environmental justice agenda and Justice40 initiative, which requires 40% of certain federal investments to flow to disadvantaged communities that are \"marginalized, underserved, and overburdened by pollution.\"\n",
      "In a letter to New York officials dated May 5, the FHWA approved the release of the proposal's final environmental assessment, one of the final hurdles the project faced. The agency said it determined the assessment met the statutory threshold to move forward.\n",
      "Under the plan, which the state is planning to begin implementing in 2024, commuters entering midtown or downtown Manhattan could be hit with a fee of up to $23 during peak hours and up to $12 during nighttime hours. The program is projected to boost state revenue by about $1 billion.\n",
      "While the proposal was heralded as a major climate win by top New York officials — New York City Mayor Eric Adams said it would clean up the air in the most polluted communities — New Jersey lawmakers blasted it, saying it would force traffic through and increase emissions in New Jersey.\n",
      "\"As the senior senator of New Jersey, I have made it abundantly clear that it’s unacceptable for New York to try balancing its budget on the backs of New Jersey commuters. Their proposed congestion tax scheme is nothing more than a shakedown and must be defeated,\" Sen. Bob Menendez, D-N.J., said Friday.\n",
      "\"If the MTA gets its way, trucks will be backed up here in North Jersey, billowing cancer-causing pollution into the lungs of our children. I want to thank our Governor for punching back at a state that decided to use Jersey as their piggy bank to solve their years of criminal mismanagement at the MTA,\" Rep. Josh Gottheimer, D-N.J., added. \"I don’t know how the MTA Chairman looks at himself in the mirror.\"\n",

      "Original Article : Robert Kennedy Jr, a long-shot Democratic candidate for US president, has a long history of racism, antisemitism and xenophobia, and should be denied a national platform, according to a damning report seen by the Guardian.\n",
      "Kennedy, who provoked anger last week when he was filmed falsely suggesting that the coronavirus could have been “ethnically targeted” to spare Ashkenazi Jews and Chinese people, is due to testify at the US Capitol in Washington on Thursday.\n",
      "The Congressional Integrity Project, a political watchdog, called for Republicans to disinvite Kennedy after releasing a report that details his meetings with and promotion of racists, antisemites and extremist conspiracy theorists.\n",
      "“Kennedy embraces virtually every conspiracy theory in existence,” the report states. “His horrific antisemitic and xenophobic views are simply beyond the pale, and he has frequently met with and promoted antisemitic conspiracy theorists. Kennedy’s anti-vaccine conspiracies go back decades and have had deadly real world consequences.”\n",
      "Kennedy, an environmental lawyer, is running against Joe Biden in the Democratic presidential primary and has drawn big and enthusiastic crowds and polled as high as 20%. But the Project’s document argues that Kennedy’s recent comments about Jewish and Chinese people, which were quickly hailed by neo-Nazis and Holocaust deniers as “100% correct”, were not an aberration but fitted a long pattern.\n",
      "Earlier this summer Kennedy touted a meeting with Ice Cube, a rapper who issued bizarre antisemitic tweets, and publicly defended musician Roger Waters, who was embroiled in controversy after donning a costume intended to evoke Nazi attire at a concert in Germany.\n",
      "The report says Kennedy has also repeatedly promoted and praised fringe online broadcaster James Corbett, a Sandy Hook and 9/11 conspiracy theorist who has claimed that “Hitler and the Nazis were 100% completely and utterly set up”.\n",
      "Kennedy has often allied himself with the National of Islam leader, Louis Farrakhan, who regularly unleashed tirades about alleged Jewish control of media and government. Kennedy met Farrakhan at his Chicago home in 2015, with Farrakhan later tweeting that they discussed “a vaccine that is designed to affect Black males”.\n",
      "The Project details how Kennedy himself has frequently invoked Nazi Germany when pushing debunked theories about vaccines. He put out a video that showed the infectious disease expert Anthony Fauci with a moustache reminiscent of Adolf Hitler and used the word “holocaust” to describe children he believes were hurt by vaccines in 2015.\n",
      "Last year, at a Washington rally organized by his group Children’s Health Defense, Kennedy complained that people’s rights were being violated by public health measures that had been taken to reduce the number of people sickened and killed by Covid-19. He said: “Even in Hitler’s Germany, you could cross the Alps to Switzerland. You could hide in an attic like Anne Frank did.” He later apologised.\n",
      "For years, the document says, Kennedy has targeted a particularly dangerous form of vaccine denial at Black people. In 2021 at the height of the Covid-19 vaccination campaign, he released Medical Racism, a film that promoted disproven claims about the dangers of vaccines and explicitly warned communities of color to be suspicious of “sinister” vaccination campaigns.\n",
      "Several doctors and experts who participated in the film later denounced it and said they felt used and misled about the message of the documentary. Richard Allen Williams, founder of the Association of Black Cardiologists, called Children’s Health Defense “absolutely a racist operation” particularly dangerous to the Black community.\n",
      "In 2017, as a measles outbreak devastated Minnesota’s Somali-American community due to low vaccination rates, Kennedy continued to push his false claims that “science and anecdotal evidence suggest that Africans and African Americans may be particularly vulnerable to vaccine injuries including autism”.\n",
      "In a 2020 interview, Kennedy asserted without evidence that “People with African blood react differently to vaccines than people with Caucasian blood. They’re much more sensitive.”\n",
      "The following year, amid the Covid-19 pandemic, Kennedy recorded a webinar encouraging Black people to be skeptical of vaccines, claiming: “There has been abundant evidence … beyond any dispute that Blacks are disproportionately harmed by vaccine injury,” adding: “Blacks react completely differently to vaccines … we now know it’s just one huge experiment on Black Americans, and they know what is happening and they are doing nothing.”\n",
      "The report also argues that, from the earliest days of Operation Warp Speed, Kennedy has built “an anti-vaccine juggernaut” around opposition to Covid-19 vaccinations, which he has called “the deadliest vaccine ever made”.\n",
      "He has sought to frame Covid vaccines as an elaborate conspiracy to enrich the medical establishment and big pharmaceutical companies. In a YouTube video, Kennedy accused Bill Gates of developing an “injectable chip” to enable the tracking of human movements and attempting to “genetically modify” humanity to “the flow of global information”.\n",
      "Kennedy has even accused his former anti-vaccine ally, Donald Trump, of selling out to Pfizer by developing vaccines.\n",
      "Such anti-scientific views go way back. Kennedy has claimed that fluoridated water is “drugging” children, HIV does not cause Aids and chemicals in the water are making people gay or transgender as well as pushing nonsensical conspiracy theories about wifi and 5G cellular networks.\n",
      "As the son of former attorney general Robert Kennedy, and nephew of former president John F Kennedy, Kennedy has caused anguish to one of America’s most storied political dynasties with his toxic views.\n",
      "In 2019 three relatives wrote an opinion column for the Politico website condemning his anti-vaccine advocacy, which they held partially responsible for a measles outbreak.\n",
      "The Congressional Integrity Project contends that Kennedy is a “Republican stooge” who is being embraced by the far right in an attempt to damage Biden. He has become a regular guest on Rupert Murdoch’s Fox News and other rightwing outlets. Far-right provocateurs Roger Stone, Steve Bannon, Alex Jones and Michael Flynn have praised him.\n",
      "Now Republicans have invited Kennedy to Congress. On Thursday he is due to address the House of Representatives’ select subcommittee on the weaponization of the federal government during a hearing to examine “the federal government’s role in censoring Americans”. The panel is chaired by the Trump loyalist Jim Jordan, who has been criticised for launching bogus investigations into Biden.\n",
      "Kyle Herrig, executive director of Congressional Integrity Project, said: “Giving RFK Jr a platform to spread dangerous conspiracy theories and xenophobic and antisemitic rhetoric is a new low for Jim Jordan – and that says something.\n",
      "“Jim Jordan should stop the charade and disinvite RFK Jr immediately. Allowing this hearing to go forward is shameless and beyond the pale. Maga Republicans’ desperation is on full display this week, proving once again that they have no credibility to conduct legitimate investigations.”\n",

      "Original Article : It is over a year since I declared on my Planet Normal podcast that soon there would be no such thing as a “safe” Tory seat. When party members of 30 years’ standing email me to say they don’t just want the Conservatives to lose the general election, they are hoping for “evisceration”, you know something has gone very wrong indeed.\n",
      "With what speed have we moved from murmurs of disillusion to outright mutiny. I was not in the least bit surprised to hear that the highly respected American pollster Frank Luntz recently told the 1922 Committee of backbench MPs that any Tory MP with a majority under 15,000 should look out.\n",
      "No shock, then, that it is widely predicted that on Thursday the Conservatives will get a kicking in three by-elections, two of which a proper Tory party should have no business losing. Boris Johnson had a slim 7,210 majority in Uxbridge so it’s not unreasonable to expect a less charismatic candidate to come a cropper in west London, although Sadiq Khan’s ruinous Ulez policies could have provided an opportunity. But Selby and South Ainsty (20,137) should be a true blue Yorkshire stronghold. And what possible excuse is there for allowing Somerton and Frome (19,213 majority) to fall into the Pontius-Pilate, frangipane-scented hands of the Lib Dems who last held the seat back in 2010 with a wafer thin margin of 1,817?\n",
      "Our reassuringly competent (yet somehow lacklustre and disastrously weak) Prime Minister tells his troops that mid-term by-elections are “always difficult”. In this case, that’s like saying the Battle of Stalingrad was “a bit tricky”. It’s not as if Tory voters are gagging for the alternatives. Low turnouts in recent by-elections suggest that many previously loyal Tories are too sick at heart to vote at all. The prevailing mood was summed up in the comments under a recent Telegraph article on how other European countries were increasingly choosing Right-wing governments. “If only we had a Conservative option here,” said one wag.\n",
      "The overwhelming sense is that it’s not us who have left the party, but the party that’s left us. “I’m seriously struggling to call myself a Conservative,” emails a Tory donor who was recently invited by his MP to have dinner with Jeremy Hunt. “The irony of asking for £3,000 to have dinner with J Hunt Esq was seemingly completely lost on him,” boggles my friend.\n",
      "Sunak has an almost uncanny ability to misread the room. Even when he alights on the right topic, he invariably gets the wrong end of the stick. The Tories I know are not obsessing about students doing useless degrees. Instead, parents are resentful and distressed about what young people have suffered at the hands of universities, acting as profit centres servicing international students, particularly after the terrible time they had during the pandemic. My son graduates this summer and his uni career has been a mixture of strikes and lockdowns. For the majority of the time, he has had no access to college facilities, no clubs, no sport, hardly any in-person teaching. Basically, our boy has done distance learning while paying the full cost of his course. What a con.\n",
      "There has been no apology, no refund. Instead, students had to take their chances with exams being cancelled all around them because of lecturers downing tools. One mother told me that her daughter at Edinburgh had her language Oral cancelled as she was cycling to the exam. It might not be rescheduled, the distraught girl was told. I hear that some institutions were reduced to drafting in temporary, unqualified markers to grade papers.\n",
      "The failure to process a year’s worth of graduates stores up another generation of problems for the country. Now, that is what a Conservative government should be concerned about – holding universities to account, not agonising over the drawbacks of Hedgehog Studies at Scunthorpe Metropolitan.\n",
      "Another easy win for the Government would have been to ban self-identification in schools altogether. No longer could some stroppy, deluded 13-year-old compel teachers and fellow pupils to refer to them as a cat or whatever sex they fancied being that day. Nor would a teacher at an all-girls’ private school be ordered to apologise for greeting her class as “girls”.\n",
      "Instead, it now looks as if the much-postponed new government guidance on trans issues will be a disastrous cop-out. The advice will make it clear that schools will have to tell parents if their child wants to identify as a different gender or start using a new name – that’s big of them! – and any child who does want to self-identify “should first undergo a period of reflection”.\n",
      "What possible use is that against a cult that is aggressively grooming children?\n",
      "What would help parents to protect their children is for schools not to to be allowed to lie about a pupil’s sex. Biology matters. “Change of pronouns” equals lying about a child’s sex because girls cannot simply become boys, and vice-versa, although thousands are now being sold that pernicious fantasy.\n",
      "A hairdresser tells me that a group of 11-year-olds came into his salon recently and three of the girls asked to have all their hair shaved off because “we now identify as boys”. Their tearful mothers turned up later and admitted that they felt totally helpless. During PSHE lessons at school, their daughters had learnt they could pick a gender as easily as trying on a new set of clothes. When parents complained that their kids were too young to be exposed to that kind of thing they were called “bigots” and “transphobes”.\n",
      "You hear these chilling stories all the time. The leader of the Reclaim party, Laurence Fox, encountered it first when he asked his son for a goodnight hug and the boy replied, “You need my consent for that, dad”.\n",
      "Fox, who is standing as a candidate in the Uxbridge by-election tomorrow, went up to his son’s school and was horrified to find out that young children were being taught they could be born in the wrong body. Reclaim wants PSHE to be banned from the curriculum because it is wicked and “possibly criminal”.\n",
      "It’s obvious that the Government would enjoy massive support if it took a firm stand against the pernicious, unscientific nonsense that is being taught to our children.\n",
      "Just as I was coming to the end of this piece, an email arrived from Rory in Frome. Subject: A Few Reasons for No Longer Supporting the Conservative Party. Rory was copying me in on a “rant” to his local Tory party explaining why he, as “a once loyal but now ex-Conservative”, would not be casting his vote for their candidate in Frome tomorrow.\n",
      "All of us could come up with pretty much the same list, I reckon. Complete failure to take meaningful steps to curb illegal migration. A profoundly unconservative Chancellor “raising corporation tax at exactly the wrong time”. No attempt at NHS reform. Hiding from the culture wars. Running down our Armed forces. “Wet career politicians” who might as well be Lib Dems or Labour. Blind adherence to “back of a fag packet” net zero ideology “which will wreck the country”.\n",
      "Well said, Rory, a champion rant. If other Conservatives in Frome feel the same, then it’s game over. Who cares? Defeat will be richly deserved. When a political party thinks that appeasing their enemies is more important than consoling their voters, it’s no surprise if they end up friendless and unloved.\n",

      "Japan has won four of its last five matches, beating both Australia and Canada along the way, and Costa Rica has won only won one of its past 12 matches.

AFRICOM has launched four self-defense airstrikes in Somalia this month as it continues to provide air support for the Somali National Army.\n",
      "Yesterday’s strike brings the total number of US air strikes in Somalia so far this year to 13. US special operations forces additionally conducted a raid in northern Somalia earlier this year against the Islamic State.\n",
      "The strike took place about 200 miles north of the capital of Mogadishu in “a remote area near Hareeri Kalle,” AFRICOM reported in a press release. Hareeri Kalle is just south of the town of Gal-Libaax in Somalia’s central Galguduud Region. The Somali military reported an operation against Shabaab in the area in recent days, adding that it was supported by “international partners.”\n",
      "The Somali government claims to have killed around 100 Shabaab members in this operation, which is a number that cannot be independently verified. AFRICOM’s press release, though not indicative of the entire operation, provides a much smaller body count. The Somali government, much like its enemies in Shabaab, often inflates casualty numbers that its forces inflicted on Shabaab.\n",
      "“The airstrike was in support of Somali National Army forces who were engaged by the terrorist organization,” AFRICOM noted. AFRICOM assessed that no civilians were killed or wounded in the strike.\n",
      "Today’s strike was preceded by three other self-defense airstrikes, all which took place on July 8 near Afmadow, which is about 60 miles north of the southern city of Kismayo. AFRICOM reported that 10 Shabaab fighters were killed in the 3 strikes, which took place as the Somali military was engaged with the terror group.\n",
      "In the past, the U.S. military masked offensive operations and counterterrorism strikes against Shabaab, such as raids on training camps and the targeting of individual terrorists, as defensive strikes. More recently, AFRICOM’s airstrikes against Shabaab have truly been defensive in nature, with just one offensive strike reported this year.\n",
      "That air strike, which took place near Shabaab’s stronghold of Jilib in May, targeted Maalim Osman, the emir of Shabaab’s external operations wing. The terrorist leader reportedly survived. [See LWJ graphic, Detailing Shabaab’s Leadership and Key Personnel, for more]\n",
      "AFRICOM is supporting the Somali National Army as its offensive to eject Shabaab from its strongholds in southern and central Somalia has largley stalled. Shabaab has responded by attacking and overrunning Somali, Ugandan, and Ethiopian military bases, and conducting a campaign of suicide and IED attacks, as well as assassinations. [See LWJ report, Analysis: Shabaab takes advantage of slowed counter-offensive.]\n",
      "The Somalia government has been slow to actually implement the so-called second phase of its much-touted offensive, though counter-Shabaab operations in Somalia’s south have picked up in recent weeks. The problem is compounded by internal Somali clan infighting in Middle Shabelle and political squabbles in Hiraan, the imminent withdrawal of thousands of troops from the African Union Transition Mission in Somalia (ATMIS) over the next several months. This turmoil further leaves Somali troops with less support and provides more opportunities for Shabaab to exploit any potential security gaps. [Listen to Generation Jihad podcast, Is Africa the epicenter of today’s jihad?, for more information.]\n",
      "For instance, Shabaab is currently imposing a blockade against the southern city of Baidoa, impacting the ability of tens of thousands to access food and supplies. That Shabaab is currently able to blockade a city of this size should stand as a warning sign that the fight against it is far from over and that any premature announcements of victory harm the Somali government’s narrative.\n",
      "And for its part, AFRICOM continues to describe Shabaab as “the largest and most kinetically active al Qaeda network in the world” that “has proved both its will and capability to attack partner and U.S. forces and threaten U.S. security interests.”\n",

      "Biden will sign a proclamation on Tuesday to create the Emmett Till and Mamie Till-Mobley National Monument across three sites in Illinois and Mississippi, according to the official. The individual spoke on condition of anonymity because the White House had not formally announced the president's plans.\n",
      "Tuesday is the anniversary of Emmett Till's birth in 1941.\n",
      "The monument will protect places that are central to the story of Till's life and death at age 14, the acquittal of his white killers and his mother's activism. Till's mother's insistence on an open casket to show the world how her son had been brutalized and Jet's magazine's decision to publish photos of his mutilated body helped galvanize the Civil Rights Movement.\n",
      "Biden's decision also comes at a fraught time in the United States over matters concerning race. Conservative leaders are pushing back against the teaching of slavery and Black history in public schools, as well as the incorporation of diversity, equity and inclusion programs from college classrooms to corporate boardrooms.\n",
      "On Friday, Vice President Kamala Harris criticized a revised Black history curriculum in Florida that includes teaching that enslaved people benefited from the skills they learned at the hands of the people who denied them freedom. The Florida Board of Education approved the curriculum to satisfy legislation signed by Gov. Ron DeSantis, a Republican presidential candidate who has accused public schools of liberal indoctrination.\n",
      "\"How is it that anyone could suggest that in the midst of these atrocities that there was any benefit to being subjected to this level of dehumanization?\" Harris asked in a speech delivered from Jacksonville, Florida.\n",

      "Till was visiting relatives in Mississippi when Carolyn Bryant Donham said the 14-year-old Till whistled and made sexual advances at her while she worked in a store in the small community of Money.\n",
      "Till was later abducted and his body eventually pulled from the Tallahatchie River, where he had been tossed after he was shot and weighted down with a cotton gin fan.\n",
      "Two white men, Roy Bryant and his half-brother J.W. Milam, were tried on murder charges about a month after Till was killed, but an all-white Mississippi jury acquitted them. Months later, they confessed to killing Till in a paid interview with Look magazine. Bryant was married to Donham in 1955. She died earlier this year.\n",
      "The monument will be the fourth Biden has created since taking office in 2021, and just his latest tribute to the younger Till.\n",

      "U.S. intelligence has no doubt that Russia has already transported the first batch of tactical nuclear weapons to Belarus.\n",
      "However, the head of Ukrainian military intelligence, Kyrylo Budanov, believes that Russia will not launch a nuclear strike against Ukraine.\n",
      "Caribbean Crisis\n",
      "This tense standoff between the United States and the Soviet Union arose from the secret placement of Soviet nuclear missiles in Cuba in 1962, in response to the installation of missiles in Turkey. The superpowers came close to direct military confrontation and the imminent threat of nuclear war.\n",

      "They knew the rain, which ensured the game ended in a draw, was forecast for the last two days and were in survival mode, rather than looking to attack and dominate.\n",
      "It was not the normal Australian way but I would never call it 'Un-Australian' because this is a successful Test team.\n",
      "They did what they had to do.\n",
      "It may have looked ugly and negative but Australia's tactics worked. Their first job when arriving here was to retain the Ashes, which they have now done courtesy of their 2-1 lead with one match to play.\n",
      "But Australia's next job is to go and win a series in England for the first time since 2001 and I am hoping we see a different mindset at The Oval from Thursday.\n",
      "- England denied by rain as Australia retain the Ashes\n",
      "- 'How are we supposed to feel?' England's Ashes hopes washed away\n",
      "I have to be honest, England dominated this match.\n",
      "It was their 'Bazball' style in its finest form but Ben Stokes' decision not to declare earlier on day three cost them victory.\n",
      "England were 506-8, leading by 189, but Stokes decided to bat long into the afternoon session.\n",
      "Jonny Bairstow's 99 not out may have been brilliant for team morale but had Stokes pulled out England would have had another 10 overs when the ball was reverse swinging late on the third day.\n",
      "England can say they were unlucky but it rained as much as was forecast.\n",
      "Afterwards Stokes talked about the bigger picture, his desire to reenergise the longest format, and that is important.\n",
      "But it is worrying me England might be using that as a tactic to deflect - that they are doing everything they can to take all of the pressure off themselves.\n",
      "Yes, talk about your style of play but once you cross that line you have to do everything to win.\n",
      "England have the attributes to become a great team but the best teams embrace the pressure. They should have declared at lunch and backed themselves to bowl Australia out.\n",
      "Still, there is much to admire about England and this Test will be remembered for Zak Crawley's brilliant 189.\n",
      "I have always been a big fan of Crawley and, on the best batting surface of the series, he gave Pat Cummins his most difficult day as Australia captain.\n",
      "As England racked up 592 at almost five-and-a-half runs per over, Cummins looked tired - not physically but mentally.\n",
      "He has done an excellent job since being appointed in 2021, winning the Ashes at home, the World Test Championship this year and had not had any real negative press.\n",
      "In Manchester he was put under the pump for the first time.\n",
      "Being skipper as a bowler is a hard job. You cannot wander down to fine leg between overs and switch off and the difficulty goes up another level in an Ashes series, when there is so much outside noise.\n",
      "Cummins will now know all about it. The true Test of his captaincy will come at The Oval.\n",
      "He had Sunday with his feet up and the pressure should be alleviated now Australia have retained the urn.\n",
      "I hope Australia take something from the best of England's style when they turn up in south London and analyse what happened this week.\n",
      "Cummins and the management have had this plan to set the field back ever since the opening delivery of the series but it was not the fours and sixes that hurt them at Old Trafford. It was the constant availability of ones and twos that had the bigger impact.\n",
      "You have got to back yourself to force a batter to hit good shots for boundaries off good balls more often. Set a field with more chance of getting a wicket.\n",
      "Australia may say this ploy has worked but now they have retained the Ashes I would like to see them be more aggressive. Play with freedom and take to the field without fear.\n",
      "We saw it from Marnus Labuschagne with his century at Old Trafford on day four, and Mitchell Marsh at Headingley.\n",
      "I would rather see Australia lose the last Test by backing themselves, really taking it to England, rather than going down with a whimper.\n",
      "Winning in England for the first time since 2001, beating this energised England team under Stokes and coach Brendon McCullum, should be massive motivation.\n",
      "To return to Australia with a 3-1 victory would be huge response to Bazball - an incredible achievement.\n",
      "People will say England could be 3-0 up and they would be right.\n",
      "Had they been smarter earlier in the series, not dropped so many vital catches, they would still be alive. They certainly should have won the first Test at Edgbaston.\n",
      "But England have also had the better of conditions and won four tosses.\n",
      "Ultimately the series has been so tight it is pointless trying to debate which way the score should or should not be. The first three Tests could have gone either way.\n",
      "Now Australia need to give everything they have got. It is time to not worry about saving anything and go out and win the Ashes.\n",

      "Morgan Stanley updated Israel’s sovereign credit to a \"dislike stance,\" noting that the government has reaffirmed the trajectory of its economy in a direction that is likely to scare off investors.\n",

      "The agency added that \"the executive and legislative institutions have become less predictable and more willing to create significant risks to economic and social stability.\"\n",
      "Moody’s announcement was made outside of its standard schedule for rating updates, which would have seen the next update in October. Given the outlook of Morgan Stanley and prior statements from Moody’s, the latter can likely be expected to demote Israel’s rating as well.\n",
      "In April, the agency affirmed Israel’s sovereign credit rating at \"A1\" but downgraded the outlook on the Israeli government's credit ratings to \"stable\" from its prior status as \"positive.\" Moody’s cited “a weakening of institutional strength and policy predictability” and “a deterioration of Israel's governance” as its primary concerns for Israel’s economy.\n",

      "\"Israel's economy is based on solid foundations and will continue to grow under an experienced leadership that leads a responsible economic policy.\"\n",
      "For months, hundreds of economists, experts, and executives throughout Israel and around the world have warned against the current government’s plan for judicial reform, claiming that it will lead to a sharp decline in foreign investment due to a lack of economic stability brought about by the weakened legal system.\n",

      "The revelation that former President Trump faces a possible grand jury indictment connected to the Jan. 6, 2021, attack and his efforts to hold on to power has landed like a bombshell on Capitol Hill, where lawmakers saw firsthand the violence unleashed that day.\n",
      "Some GOP lawmakers rushed to Trump’s defense, but many Republicans in the Senate held back from defending the former president, who has been accused of stoking the Jan. 6 mob and who waited before calling on protesters to disperse.\n",
      "The expected indictment separately poses a tough political problem for many Republicans critical of Trump, who remains wildly popular with the party’s base.\n",
      "Senate Republican Leader Mitch McConnell (Ky.), who hasn’t spoken to Trump since December 2020, stayed quiet about the news of yet another indictment against his onetime ally, who is now leading the Republican presidential primary field by 30 points in national polls.\n",
      "His top deputies, Senate Republican Whip John Thune (R-S.D.) and Sen. John Cornyn (R-Texas), reacted with caution.\n",
      "Asked whether it would be “legitimate” for special counsel Jack Smith to charge Trump for trying to overturn the results of the 2020 election, Thune said it would depend on the facts and evidence presented.\n",
      "“That’s going to depend on whether or not laws were broken,” he said. “So clearly, I don’t know what they’re looking at. But I’m sure we’ll know in due time.”\n",
      "Cornyn dodged the politically charged topic altogether, arguing the Justice Department has the authority to investigate whether Trump broke the laws in trying to stop the certification of the 2020 election.\n",
      "“I think that’s entirely within the purview of the Department of Justice and has nothing to do with the United States Senate,” he said.\n",
      "Asked if Smith is a “credible prosecutor,” he said, “I have no knowledge of anything approaching that.”\n",
      "Senate Republican Conference Chairman John Barrasso (R-Wyo.), who called the indictment of Trump last month for violating the Espionage Act “political” and “rotten,” was the only senior member of the Republican leadership to accuse the Justice Department of acting on political motives.\n",
      "“It looks like the president is targeting his most popular opponent. Isn’t that interesting? Sounds political to me,” he said.\n",
      "Asked if he saw any qualitative difference between the 37 felony counts federal prosecutors brought against Trump last month for refusing to turn over classified documents he kept improperly at Mar-a-Lago and new charges related to Jan. 6, Barrasso saw both indictments as political attacks.\n",
      "“The administration is siccing its dogs on the former president of the United States and their most formidable opponent,” he said.\n",
      "Senate Republican Conference Vice Chairwoman Shelley Moore Capito (R-W.Va.) only said, “It’s a never-ending story, that’s my comment.”\n",
      "The generally muted response from Senate Republican leaders posed a stark contrast with House Republican leaders, who rushed to Trump’s defense.\n",
      "Speaker Kevin McCarthy (R-Calif.) suggested the Justice Department is bringing new charges against Trump because he is leading the Republican presidential field by double digits and pulled ahead of President Biden in a recent poll.\n",
      "“Recently, President Trump went up in the polls and was actually surpassing President Biden for reelection. So what do they do now? Weaponize government to go after their No. 1 opponent,” McCarthy said Tuesday.\n",
      "“This is not equal justice. They treat people differently and they go after their adversaries,” he said.\n",
      "McCarthy’s comments reveal how his views of Trump’s culpability for the attack on the Capitol have evolved since January 2021, when he told GOP colleagues that Trump “bears responsibility for his words and actions — no if, ands or buts.”\n",
      "House Majority Leader Steve Scalise (R-La.) accused the Justice Department of waging a politically motivated prosecution to distract from a whistleblower’s claims that senior administration officials interfered with an Internal Revenue Service investigation of Hunter Biden.\n",
      "“Now you see the Biden administration going after President Trump once again, and it begs that question, ‘Is there a double standard? Is justice being administered equally?’” Scalise asked at a press conference.\n",
      "Other Trump allies in the House joined the attack against the administration.\n",
      "House Judiciary Committee Chairman Jim Jordan (R-Ohio) claimed Biden’s Justice Department did little to prosecute Black Lives Matter protesters who breached a federal courthouse in 2020 or to prosecute threats against conservative Supreme Court justices.\n",
      "“But if you’re President Trump and do nothing wrong? PROSECUTE. Americans are tired of the double standard!” he tweeted.\n",
      "Another Trump ally, Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene (R-Ga.), attacked Smith on Twitter as a “lousy attorney” and pointed to the Supreme Court overturning his conviction of former Virginia Gov. Bob McDonnell (R).\n",
      "“He only targets Republicans because he’s a weak little bitch for the Democrats,” she tweeted.\n",
      "Senate Republicans, many of whom have made clear they don’t want to see Trump as the party’s nominee for president in 2024, however, broke with their House GOP colleagues over the claim that the Justice Department is operating a “two-tier” system and holding Trump to a special standard.\n",
      "“I think you’ve got to go where the facts lead you and determine whether or not laws are broken. But there shouldn’t be two systems of justice; everybody should be held accountable and there ought to be equal justice under the law,” Thune told reporters.\n",
      "“Clearly in these circumstances, it’s a politically charged environment. I think it puts an even higher burden of proof on the Justice Department given the perceptions that people have about that but this has got to be driven by the law and the facts,” he said.\n",
      "McConnell excoriated Trump on the Senate floor at the end of his 2021 impeachment trial for inciting the mob that stormed the Capitol hallways and ransacked the Senate parliamentarian’s office.\n",
      "“There is no question that President Trump is practically and morally responsible for provoking the events of that day,” he declared, referring to the violence and chaos that resulted in injuries to more than 100 Capitol police officers.\n",
      "One officer, Brian Sicknick, died of natural causes while defending the Capitol.\n",
      "Thune said just because the Senate Republicans’ top leader called Trump “practically and morally” responsible, that did not necessarily warrant criminal charges.\n",
      "“Practically and morally is something very different than legally, and I think that’s what the Justice Department has to look at. They’ve got to look at the law, the facts as they’ve interviewed people, and then make a determination about whether laws were broken,” he said.\n",
      "Sen. Mitt Romney (R-Utah), who voted twice to convict Trump on impeachment charges — including on the charge of inciting the Jan. 6 riot — warned his House GOP colleagues about relentlessly attacking the Justice Department.\n",
      "He voiced concern about “the diminution of institutions in which we rely as a society.”\n",
      "“A democracy works when we have confidence in the justice system, in the legal system, in our prosecutors and so forth. If we constantly attack and diminish them, that weakens the democracy,” he said.\n",

      "Alibaba Group Holdings said in a filing Sunday that it will not participate in Ant’s share buyback program. It allows shareholders to sell back up to 7.6% of their holdings at an unspecified price that values the company at 567.1 billion yuan ($78.8 billion).\n",
      "Ant, which operates one of China’s leading mobile payments services Alipay, has seen its valuation fall nearly 70% from about $280 billion ($38.9 billion) at the time it was planning an IPO in 2020. That was derailed by regulators who conducted an investigation into the firm and then fined it nearly $100 billion for violating laws and regulations in the payments sector.\n",
      "Given the plunge in Ant's valuation, investors who sell their shares to Ant will likely get far less than they would have gotten in 2020.\n",
      "“Given that Ant Group continues to be an important strategic partner to Alibaba Group’s various businesses, Alibaba Group has decided that it will not sell any shares to Ant Group under the proposed share repurchase, so as to maintain its shareholding in Ant Group,” Alibaba said in the filing.\n",

      "The president will sign a proclamation on Tuesday to create the Emmett Till and Mamie Till-Mobley national monument across three sites in Illinois and Mississippi, according to the official. The individual spoke on condition of anonymity because the White House had not formally announced the president’s plans.\n",
      "Tuesday is the anniversary of Emmett Till’s birth in 1941.\n",
      "The monument will protect places that are central to the story of Till’s life and death at age 14, the acquittal of his white killers and his mother’s activism. Till’s mother’s insistence on an open casket to show the world how her son had been brutalized and Jet’s magazine’s decision to publish photos of his mutilated body helped galvanize the civil rights movement.\n",
      "Biden’s decision also comes at a fraught time in the United States over matters concerning race. Conservative leaders are pushing back against the teaching of slavery and Black history in public schools, as well as the incorporation of diversity, equity and inclusion programs from college classrooms to corporate boardrooms.\n",

      "The monument to Till and his mother will include three sites in the two states.\n",
      "The Illinois site is Roberts Temple Church of God in Christ in Bronzeville, a historically Black neighborhood on Chicago’s South Side. Thousands of people gathered at the church to mourn Emmett Till in September 1955.\n",
      "The Mississippi locations are Graball Landing, believed to be where Till’s mutilated body was pulled from the Tallahatchie River, and the Tallahatchie county second district courthouse in Sumner, Mississippi, where Till’s killers were tried and acquitted by an all-white jury.\n",
      "Till was visiting relatives in Mississippi when Carolyn Bryant Donham said the 14-year-old Till whistled and made sexual advances at her while she worked in a store in the small community of Money.\n",
      "Till was later abducted and his body eventually pulled from the Tallahatchie River, where he had been tossed after he was shot and weighted down with a cotton gin fan.\n",
      "Two white men, Roy Bryant and his half-brother JW Milam, were tried on murder charges about a month after Till was killed, but an all-white Mississippi jury acquitted them. Months later, they confessed to killing Till in a paid interview with Look magazine. Bryant was married to Donham in 1955. She died earlier this year.\n",

      "Rep. Lauren Boebert (R-Colo.) offered an apology Saturday “for the appearance” of disrespecting children who died in the Uvalde shooting, after footage of the congresswoman discarding a tribute pin for one of the victims prompted a wave of harsh criticism.\n",
      "“If anyone thinks that I was disrespecting a child who tragically lost their lives at the hands of an evil, evil person, I want to apologize for the appearance of that. But that’s not at all what it was,” she said.\n",
      "In a video that circulated late last week, an activist appears to hand Boebert a pamphlet and a pin. The pin honored one of the 19 children who died in a mass shooting at Robb Elementary School in Uvalde, Texas.\n",

      "- Church attendance down an average four points since before the pandemic\n",
      "- Declines in attendance are seen among most key subgroups\n",
      "- Churchgoers are mainly back in person, but 5% still attend virtually\n",
      "WASHINGTON, D.C. -- U.S. church attendance has shown a small but noticeable decline compared with what it was before the COVID-19 pandemic. In the four years before the pandemic, 2016 through 2019, an average of 34% of U.S. adults said they had attended church, synagogue, mosque or temple in the past seven days. From 2020 to the present, the average has been 30%, including a 31% reading in a May 1-24 survey.\n",
      "The recent church attendance levels are about 10 percentage points lower than what Gallup measured in 2012 and most prior years.\n",
      "The coronavirus pandemic caused millions of Americans to avoid public gatherings, and many houses of worship were closed to help limit the spread of COVID-19. Still, Americans were able to worship remotely through services broadcast over the internet, television or radio. Most of those who reported attending religious services in 2020 said they did so virtually. Even accounting for remote attendance, however, church attendance figures were lower than in prior years.\n",
      "It is not clear if the pandemic is the cause of the reduced attendance or if the decline is a continuation of trends that were already in motion. However, the temporary closure of churches and ongoing COVID-19 avoidance activities did get many Americans out of the habit of attending religious services weekly.\n",
      "Attendance rates since 2020 are lower among nearly every major subgroup. The main exceptions are groups that had low levels of church attendance before the pandemic, including adults with no religious affiliation and political liberals.\n",
      "Church attendance is down four points among Protestants (from 44% to 40%) and seven points among Catholics (from 37% to 30%), the two largest faith groups in the U.S. Sample sizes for those in other religious groups are too small to provide reliable estimates for the period covered in this analysis.\n",
      "Republicans, Democrats and independents show similar declines in church attendance since the pandemic began -- between three and five percentage points -- though Republicans (40%) remain much more likely than Democrats (25%) or independents (25%) to attend religious services.\n",
      "Attendance Has Shifted From Virtual to In-Person\n",
      "The first time Gallup asked about church attendance after the pandemic began, in April 2020, 31% of U.S. adults said they had attended religious services in the past seven days, with 27% doing so virtually and 4% in person. For much of 2020, far more attended virtually than in person, with overall attendance rates ranging from 25% to 31%.\n",
      "In May 2021, after COVID-19 vaccines were widely available, overall church attendance was steady at 30%, with about twice as many attending in person as remotely.\n",
      "Since then, the percentage attending in person has continued to grow, to 26% in the May 2023 survey. Now, just 5% say they attend virtually. Those numbers are essentially the reverse of what Gallup measured in the early months of the pandemic.\n",
      "The current figures indicate that 84% of U.S. adults who recently attended religious services did so in person, while 16% did so remotely. The proportions of in-person and remote attendance are generally similar by subgroup.\n",
      "Bottom Line\n",
      "The pandemic had a profound effect on U.S. society, and it continues to have an impact in some ways. Americans have been less likely to attend religious services over the past three years, and at this point, it does not appear that church attendance will revert to pre-pandemic levels. These recent trends have added to the longer-term decline in religious participation that Gallup has documented over the past two decades.\n",

      "Original Article : Manchester United have signed goalkeeper Andre Onana from Inter Milan for a fee of around €50 million ($56.1m). David de Gea's 12-year spell at Old Trafford came to an end earlier this month when he opted to leave on a free transfer, but how will the 27-year-old Onana fare as a replacement?\n",
      "ESPN brings you all you need to know about the former Cameroon international.\n",
      "Early career and info\n",
      "Onana was spotted playing on the streets of Cameroon's capital city Yaounde by a member of the Samuel Eto'o Foundation -- the charity set up by the country's all-time top scorer and former Barcelona and Inter Milan forward. He was signed by Barcelona at age 14 and played in the Blaugrana's La Masia youth academy, where he became the No. 1 goalkeeper at his age group.\n",
      "Developing his technical and physical skills during his time in Catalonia, the 6-foot-2 stopper became comfortable with the ball at his feet -- playing out from the back and transitioning play well -- to become a standout at under-19 level. But with a desire for regular first-team football, and Marc-Andre ter Stegen a fixture between the posts for the senior side, he decided to make the switch to Ajax in 2015, making his debut in 2016-17 season.\n",
      "At Ajax he met manager Erik ten Hag, who arrived at the Johan Cruijff Arena in 2017. With his years at La Masia behind him, the Cameroon star proved to be a perfect fit for Ten Hag's possession-based style of play. In total, he made 214 appearances and picked up a hat trick of Eredivisie titles, as well as two Dutch cups, while he helped guide Ajax to the semifinals of the Champions League in 2019.\n",
      "A nine-month ban for a doping violation, which Onana said was down to accidentally taking a medicine meant for his girlfriend, saw his career stall in 2021. But he returned to action in November and helped Cameroon to a third-placed finish at the Africa Cup of Nations on home soil.\n",
      "He opted not to extend his Ajax contract and signed for Inter on a free transfer in the summer of 2022, but controversy was not far away again as he quit international football in December after being sent home from the World Cup in Qatar after a disagreement over tactics.\n",
      "Onana established himself as one of the best goalkeepers in Europe and shone in the 2022-23 Champions League, helping Inter to the final where they narrowly lost out 1-0 to Manchester City. He conceded only 36 goals in 41 games at Inter, keeping 19 clean sheets.\n",
      "Key Stats\n",
      "Last season's league stats indicate that Onana is a clear upgrade on De Gea in terms of build-up play. The 27-year-old averaged 27.1 passes in his own half, compared to De Gea's 17.1. He was also more accurate with his passing with a 79.17% completion rate against De Gea's 68.33%.\n",
      "Onana had a slightly better save percentage (72.09%) than De Gea (70.14%), but the Spaniard did face 58 more shots.\n",
      "When compared to some top Premier League goalkeepers, the data shows that Onana also had a better save percentage than both Liverpool's Alisson (71.52%) and Manchester City's Ederson (58.97%). Onana faced a similar number of shots (85) to Ederson (78) and made 62 saves, compared to his 46; while Alisson made 108 saves from 149 shots to sum up Liverpool's poor season.\n",
      "Onana's passing wasn't quite as accurate as Alisson (83.37%) or Ederson (84.40%), but he did show an greater tendency to play the ball forward (17.8 times per 90 mins, compared to 14.8 and 13.9 respectively) -- a trait that should suit the style of his new team well.\n",
      "Strengths\n",
      "Manchester United will benefit immediately from Onana's buildup play. Ten Hag hasn't always been able to deploy the system he has wanted to since arriving at Old Trafford, but the acquisition of Onana should have a similar impact to when he signed another of his former Ajax players for United: centre-back Lisandro Martinez.\n",
      "Onana is a clear upgrade on De Gea with the ball at his feet, but is also more capable under pressure and can find his way out of trouble by forcing attackers off balance with quick turns before distributing the ball.\n",
      "He excels at making reflex saves and has impressive reactions. He protects his near post well and is generally reliable in stopping shots from inside the box.\n",
      "Some goalkeepers are much less comfortable when forced onto their weaker foot, but United fans shouldn't to see that with Onana. He is capable with both feet when passing and clearing the ball.\n",
      "Areas to improve\n",
      "At 27, Onana is yet to reach his prime as a goalkeeper but needs to deal better with long shots. Generally, more consistency is required and while Onana is often quick to come off his line, he can sometimes be hesitant with his decision-making when the attacker gets to the ball first in one-vs.-one situations.\n",
      "How will he fit at Manchester United?\n",
      "De Gea played a key role at United since arriving from Atletico Madrid for around €25m in 2011, but it was vital that the club found a goalkeeper who fitted the core principles of Ten Hag's tactical system. Despite his high level of ability at stopping shots, De Gea wasn't at the required level with the ball at his feet and made too many mistakes.\n",
      "The addition of Onana was Man United's No. 1 priority this summer and he can help the club take the next step.\n",
      "More adept at dealing with the opposition's press with his passing and dribbling ability, his consistency in transitioning the ball forward at a higher success rate means Manchester United will enjoy a greater number of attacks during a game. He should also take little time to settle under Ten Hag, having enjoyed their time together at Ajax.\n",
      "All things considered, it seems an excellent move for United, who have locked down their No. 1 spot for the foreseeable future.\n",

      "Original Article : MINNEAPOLIS -- Former Minneapolis police Officer Derek Chauvin will ask the U.S. Supreme Court to review his conviction for second-degree murder in the killing of George Floyd, now that the Minnesota Supreme Court has declined to hear the case, his attorney said Wednesday.\n",
      "The state’s highest court without comment denied Chauvin’s petition in a one-page order dated Tuesday, letting Chauvin’s conviction and 22 1/2-year sentence stand. Chauvin faces long odds at the U.S. Supreme Court, which hears only about 100 to 150 appeals of the more than 7,000 cases it is asked to review every year.\n",
      "Floyd, who was Black, died on May 25, 2020, after Chauvin, who is white, pressed a knee on his neck for 9 1/2 minutes on the street outside a convenience store where Floyd tried to pass a counterfeit $20 bill. A bystander video captured Floyd’s fading cries of “I can’t breathe.” Floyd’s death touched off protests worldwide, some of which turned violent, and forced a national reckoning with police brutality and racism that is still playing out.\n",
      "Chauvin's attorney, William Mohrmann, told The Associated Press that they were “obviously disappointed” in the decision. He said the most significant issue on which they appealed was whether holding the proceedings in Minneapolis in 2021 deprived Chauvin of his right to a fair trial due to pretrial publicity and concerns for violence in the event of an acquittal. He said they will now raise that issue with the U.S. Supreme Court.\n",
      "“This criminal trial generated the most amount of pretrial publicity in history,” Morhmann said. “More concerning are the riots which occurred after George Floyd’s death (and) led the jurors to all express concerns for their safety in the event they acquitted Mr. Chauvin — safety concerns which were fully evidenced by surrounding the courthouse in barbed wire and National Guard troops during the trial and deploying the National Guard throughout Minneapolis prior to jury deliberations.”\n",
      "Mohrmann asked the Minnesota Supreme Court in May to hear the case after the Minnesota Court of Appeals in April rejected his arguments that he had been denied a fair trial. The Minnesota attorney general’s office, in a response last month, asked the Supreme Court to let that ruling stand instead.\n",
      "“Petitioner received a fair trial, and received the benefit of a fulsome appellate review,” prosecutors wrote at the time. “It is time to bring this case to a close.”\n",
      "The attorney general's office did not immediately reply to a request for comment Wednesday.\n",
      "Morhman asked the Court of Appeals and the Minnesota Supreme Court to throw out the ex-officer’s conviction for a long list of reasons, including the decision by Hennepin County Judge Peter Cahill not to move the trial out of Minneapolis despite the massive pretrial publicity, and the potential prejudicial effects of unprecedented courthouse security.\n",
      "After his conviction on the state charge, Chauvin pleaded guilty to a separate federal civil rights charge and was sentenced to 21 years in federal prison, which he is serving in Arizona concurrent with his state sentence. Three other former officers who assisted Chauvin are serving shorter state and-or federal sentences for their roles in the case.\n",
      "Only Tou Thao, who held back the concerned crowd, still faces sentencing in state court. That's scheduled for Aug. 7. Thao rejected a plea agreement and, instead of going to trial, let Cahill decide the case based on written filings by each side and evidence presented in previous trials.\n",

      "Original Article : The Fulton county district attorney investigating Donald Trump’s efforts to overturn the 2020 election results in the state of Georgia has developed sufficient evidence to charge a sprawling racketeering indictment next month, according to two people briefed on the matter.\n",
      "The racketeering statute in Georgia requires prosecutors to show the existence of an “enterprise” – and a pattern of racketeering activity that is predicated on at least two “qualifying” crimes.\n",
      "In the Trump investigation, the Fulton county district attorney, Fani Willis, has amassed enough evidence to pursue a racketeering indictment predicated on statutes related to influencing witnesses and computer trespass, the people said.\n",
      "Willis had previously said she was weighing racketeering charges in her criminal investigation, but the new details about the direction and scope of the case come as prosecutors are expected to seek indictments starting in the first two weeks of August.\n",
      "The racketeering statute in Georgia is more expansive than its federal counterpart, notably because any attempts to solicit or coerce the qualifying crimes can be included as predicate acts of racketeering activity, even when those crimes cannot be indicted separately.\n",
      "The specific evidence was not clear, though the charge regarding influencing witnesses could include Trump’s conversations with Georgia’s secretary of state, Brad Raffensperger, in which he asked Raffensperger to “find” 11,780 votes, the people said – and thereby implicate Trump.\n",
      "For the computer trespass charge, where prosecutors would have to show that defendants used a computer or network without authority to interfere with a program or data, that would include the breach of voting machines in Coffee county, the two people said.\n",
      "The breach of voting machines involved a group of Trump operatives – paid by the then Trump lawyer Sidney Powell – accessing the voting machines at the county’s election office and copying sensitive voting system data.\n",
      "The copied data from the Dominion Voting System machines, which is used statewide in Georgia, was then uploaded to a password-protected site from where election deniers could download the materials as part of a misguided effort to prove the 2020 election had been rigged.\n",
      "Though Coffee county is outside the jurisdiction of the Fulton county district attorney’s office, folding a potential computer trespass charge into a wider racketeering case would allow prosecutors to also seek an indictment for what the Trump operatives did there, the people said.\n",
      "A spokesperson for Willis did not respond to requests for comment.\n",
      "The district attorney’s office has spent more than two years investigating whether Trump and his allies interfered in the 2020 election in Georgia, while prosecutors at the federal level are scrutinizing Trump’s efforts to reverse his defeat that culminated in the January 6 Capitol attack.\n",
      "A special grand jury in Atlanta that heard evidence for roughly seven months recommended charges for more than a dozen people, including the former president himself, its forewoman strongly suggested in interviews, though Willis will have to seek indictments from a regular grand jury.\n",
      "The grand jury that could decide whether to return an indictment against Trump was seated on 11 July. The selection process was attended by Willis and two prosecutors known to be on the Trump investigation: her deputy district attorney, Will Wooten, and special prosecutor Nathan Wade.\n",
      "Charges stemming from the Trump investigation are expected to come between the final week of July and the first two weeks of August, the Guardian has previously reported, after Willis told her team to shift to remote work during that period because of security concerns.\n",
      "The district attorney originally suggested charging decisions were “imminent” in January, but the timetable has been repeatedly delayed after a number of Republicans who acted as fake electors accepted immunity deals as the investigation neared its end.\n",

      "Barber was convicted and sentenced to death for the 2001 beating death of 75-year-old Dorothy Epps. Prosecutors said Barber, a handyman, confessed to killing Epps with a claw hammer and fleeing with her purse. Jurors voted 11-1 to recommend a death sentence, which a judge imposed.\n",
      "It was the first execution carried out in Alabama this year after the state halted executions last fall. Alabama Gov. Kay Ivey announced a pause on executions in November to conduct an internal review of procedures.\n",
      "The move came after the state halted two lethal injections because of difficulties inserting IVs into the condemned men's veins. Advocacy groups claimed a third execution, carried out after a delay because of IV problems, was botched, a claim the state has disputed.\n",

      "David Zandstra, 83, of the Atlanta suburb of Marietta is charged with criminal homicide, first--, second- and third-degree murder, kidnapping of a minor and a related count in the 1975 death of Gretchen Harrington in Delaware County.\n",
      "District Attorney Jack Stollsteimer told reporters Monday in the Delaware County seat of Media that the defendant was “a monster\" and \"every parent's worst nightmare.\"\n",
      "“This is a man who is a remorseless child predator who acted as if he was a friend, a neighbor and a man of God, and he killed this poor little girl,” Stollsteimer said.\n",
      "Having killed a child who knew and trusted him, he then “acted as if he was their family friend, not only during her burial and the period after that but for years,” the district attorney said.\n",
      "Harrington, the daughter of a Presbyterian minister and his wife, disappeared in mid-August 1975 while walking from her Marple Township home to Bible camp at Trinity Church Chapel, where Zandstra was pastor. Her body was found two months later by a jogger in Ridley Creek State Park in Media.\n",
      "Harrington, usually accompanied by her sisters but alone this day because of a recent birth in her family, was offered a ride by Zandstra, who was also the father of one of her best friends, Stollsteimer alleged.\n",
      "“So when he offered her a ride in his car, of course she got in the car,” he said.\n",
      "Zandstra took her to a wooded location and eventually struck her in the head, and believing her to be dead tried to cover her body, authorities said. Returning to his church, he “tried to act like nothing had happened,” and when her father, pastor of the nearby Reformed Presbyterian Church, called seeking to find her, Zandstra was the one to call police, Stollsteimer alleged.\n",
      "Over ensuing days, hundreds of people searched nearby wooded areas, and authorities distributed more than 2,000 leaflets and set up a 24-hour hotline that took hundreds of calls, The Philadelphia Inquirer reported. When the girl’s body was found in mid-October 1975, her clothing was “folded and in a neat pile” near her body with her underwear hanging from a tree branch “like a flag ... as if to call attention to the place,” the Inquirer reported at the time.\n",
      "Stollsteimer said new information from an unnamed friend of the victim led state police to travel to Georgia and interview Zandstra, who authorities allege then confessed to the crime.\n",
      "Trooper Eugene Tray said the defendant's demeanor was “relieved\" as if it was “a weight off his shoulders.” Stollsteimer said Zandstra, however, was fighting extradition from Georgia though the prosecutor vowed that he would be returned to face justice in Pennsylvania.\n",
      "DNA from the defendant will be compared to material from open cases in Pennsylvania and elsewhere, authorities said. Zandstra lived in Texas and Georgia after leaving the commonwealth, they said. The Christian Reformed Church lists him as having ministered in New Jersey, California and Texas before retiring in 2005. Authorities said they were concerned that there may have been more victims and urged anyone with information to contact investigators.\n",
      "Zandstra remained in custody in Georgia; a message was left Monday for a Pennsylvania attorney listed as representing him.\n",
      "Gretchen Harrington's family asked for privacy but said in a statement that they were “extremely hopeful” that the person responsible would be held accountable for taking her away from them, which they said “forever altered our family and we miss her every single day.”\n",
      "“If you met Gretchen, you were instantly her friend. She exuded kindness to all and was sweet and gentle,” the family said. “Even now, when people share their memories of her, the first thing they talk about is how amazing she was and still is ... at just 8 years old, she had a lifelong impact on those around her.”\n",

      "KYIV: The Ukrainian port city of Odesa came under renewed Russian missile attack early on Sunday, just hours before President Vladimir Putin declared that Kyiv’s counteroffensive had “failed” as he began two-day talks with his Belarus counterpart and ally Alexander Lukashenko.\n",
      "The longtime leaders met for the first time since Lukashenko helped end a mutiny by Russian Wagner mercenaries in Russia last month, in the biggest threat to Putin’s more than two-decade rule.\n",
      "“There is no counteroffensive,” Lukashenko said, before being interrupted by Putin: “There is one, but it has failed.”\n",
      "On the other hand, US Secretary of State Antony Blinken in an interview to CNN on Sunday claimed that Ukraine took back about 50pc of the territory that Russia had initially seized, although Kyiv’s counteroffensive would extend several months. “These are still relatively early days of the counteroffensive. It is tough,” he said, adding: “It will not play out over the next week or two. Were still looking I think at several months.”\n",

      "The Housing Secretary on Thursday blocked Marks & Spencer from demolishing its landmark store, objecting on the ground that the project could harm the character of the area.\n",
      "Stuart Machin, chief executive of Marks & Spencer, immediately hit out at the decision which he described as “pathetic” and “anti-business”.\n",
      "M&S had planned to demolish the Art Deco building and replace it with a new 10-storey retail and office block with only two and half floors used for retail space.\n",
      "The retailer vowed to vacate the building if its plans were blocked, warning that the ongoing decline of the shopping district would “accelerate dramatically” if it left.\n",
      "The retailer argued the change was needed to help meet net zero targets and adapt to the rise of online shopping, which has led to a fall in visits to its in-person stores. It has claimed that demolishing the building, which was built in 1929, was the only way to bring it up to modern energy standards.\n",
      "Mr Machin said on Thursday: “We have been clear from the outset that there is no other viable scheme – so, after almost a century at Marble Arch, M&S is now left with no choice but to review its future position on Oxford Street on the whim of one man. It is utterly pathetic.”\n",
      "The project had secured approval from Westminster City Council and the Greater London Authority for its plans, but Mr Gove seized control of the planning application amid concerns about its environmental impact.\n",
      "The Secretary of State called in the plans because demolishing the 90-year-old building would release 40,000 tonnes of so-called embodied carbon.\n",
      "M&S claimed that 90pc of materials from the existing site would be reused in the construction of the new building, mitigating the impact of embodied carbon. The new building would also be far more energy efficient, saving on fuel needs.\n",
      "During a public inquiry, which took place last year, M&S argued that refurbishing the site would be “unsustainable” and “undeliverable”.\n",
      "The retailer said: “The current site is made up of three separate buildings with poor-quality structures and asbestos challenges, which although completely safe, make it impossible to develop without rebuilding.\n",
      "“The existing store is a confusing warren of dense structures and misaligned floors, which is not the environment in which the modern customer wants to shop, and the “backstage” area where our colleagues work is of a poor standard and impossible to modernise.”\n",
      "On Thursday, Mr Machin warned Oxford Street risked becoming the “victim of politics”.\n",
      "He added “At a time when vacancy rates on what should be the nation’s premier shopping street are 13pc higher than the average UK high street and Westminster Council is pleading for help in managing the growing proliferation of sweet shop racketeers, the Secretary of State has inexplicably taken an anti-business approach, choking off growth and denying Oxford Street thousands of new quality jobs, a better public realm and what would be a modern, sustainable, flag-bearing M&S store.”\n",
      "Other retailers in the area including Selfridges and Ikea, which will be taking the former Topshop site by Oxford Circus, had supported Marks & Spencer’s plans.\n",
      "Selfridges said the redevelopment would play a vital role in “maintaining Oxford Street as the UK’s national shop window”.\n",

      "Original Article : McCarthy denies he promised Trump vote on expunging impeachments\n",
      "Speaker Kevin McCarthy (R-Calif.) on Thursday denied making a promise to former President Trump that the House would vote to expunge his impeachments, shooting down a report that said the GOP leader pledged the vote as a way to temper tensions with the former president.\n",
      "“There’s no deal,” McCarthy told reporters Thursday, “but I’ve been very clear from long before when I voted against impeachments that they did it for purely political purposes.”\n",
      "“I support expungement but there’s no deal out there,” he added.\n",
      "Those comments contradict a Thursday morning report from Politico Playbook that McCarthy assured Trump that the House would vote to erase his impeachments, citing a source close to Trump and familiar with the conversation.\n",
      "The vow came after McCarthy, during an interview late last month, said he was unsure if Trump was the “strongest” person to beat Trump in 2024, reportedly landing him in hot water with the president.\n",
      "McCarthy launched a clean-up effort later that day, telling the conservative Breitbart News in a subsequent interview that “Trump is “Biden’s strongest political opponent,” sending out a fundraising blast with the same message, and, according to The New York Times, calling the former president for a conversation that two sources characterized as an apology.\n",
      "But according to Politico, Trump wanted an endorsement from McCarthy following the squabble, which the Speaker was not willing to offer as he seeks to stay neutral in the primary. Instead, a source told the outlet, McCarthy promised that the House would vote to expunge his impeachments.\n",
      "McCarthy later communicated, through aides, that he would hold the vote before August recess — which is set to begin next Friday — according to Politico, but he recently told the former president’s team that the vote will happen by the end of September, the outlet noted.\n",
      "Either of those deadlines, however, would be difficult for McCarthy to meet. The House from now through September is working on spending bills for the annual appropriations process, with a Sept. 30 deadline looming. The process is already the source of disagreements within the GOP conference.\n",
      "Even if McCarthy were to bring the expungement resolutions to the floor for a vote, it is unlikely that they would garner enough support to pass. The vote would push purple-district Republicans into a tough spot politically, and likely turn off others who are unsure if expungement is constitutionally possible.\n",
      "A number of GOP lawmakers sounded cool to the idea of Thursday, and one House Republican — who said their views “represent a fair number of principled conservatives” — said they would likely oppose any effort to erase the punishments.\n",
      "“I have every expectation I’ll vote against expungement, and I have every expectation that I will work to bring others with me,” the lawmaker said, noting that they communicated that position with leadership.\n",
      "McCarthy voiced support for expunging both of Trump’s impeachments last month, telling reporters that one of the rebukes “was not based on true facts” and the other was “on the basis of no due process.” He said it was “appropriate” to expunge them “because it never should have gone through.”\n",
      "The House — led by then-Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) — voted to impeach Trump for abuse of power and obstruction of Congress in late 2019, in response to his threat to withhold U.S. military aid to Ukraine unless leaders in Kyiv launched an investigation into Joe Biden, his political opponent. No Republicans joined Democrats in supporting the punishment.\n",
      "Then in early 2021, the House impeached Trump for a second time following the Jan. 6, 2021 attack on the Capitol, penalizing him for “incitement of insurrection.” That time around, 10 Republicans voted to impeach. Just two of them — Reps. Dan Newhouse (R-Wash.) and David Valadao (R-Calif.) — are still in Congress.\n",
      "In both scenarios, however, Republicans in the Senate acquitted Trump.\n",
      "Immediately after the Capitol riot, McCarthy took to the House floor and declared that Trump bore “responsibility” for the violence. But when it became apparent that the Republican Party was remaining loyal to Trump, he reversed his stance, meeting with Trump at his Mar-a-Lago resort in Florida a few weeks later. He later claimed that Trump did not “provoke” the attack.\n",
      "House GOP Conference Chair Elise Stefanik (N.Y.) and Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene (R-Ga.) are leading the effort to expunge Trump’s impeachments. Greene sponsored the resolution for the first impeachment, relating to Ukraine, and Stefanik is taking the lead on the second, pertaining to Jan. 6.\n",

Marjorie Taylor Greene (R-GA) briefly sent Wednesday’s House Oversight hearing into chaos when she displayed nude photos of President Joe Biden’s son Hunter engaging in sexual activities, prompting committee Democrats to deem her latest attention-grabbing stunt inappropriate.\n",
      "Wednesday’s hearing was centered on the testimony of two IRS whistleblowers who allege that the criminal probe into Hunter Biden, which resulted in a plea deal on tax charges, was mishandled by the Justice Department, who they claim gave preferential treatment to the younger Biden.\n",
      "For the first few hours, the hearing largely went as expected. Republicans touted the whistleblowers’ testimony as extremely credible while using it as a launching point for further speculation about the “Biden crime family” and allegations of foreign bribery schemes. Democrats, meanwhile, labeled the entire investigation into the Bidens as an “exercise in futility and embarrassment,” noting that House Oversight Committee Chair James Comer (R-KY) has yet to provide any evidence of the president’s wrongdoing.\n",
      "It wasn’t until Greene got her chance to ask questions, however, that the hearing really turned into a circus of the absurd.\n",
      "Armed with a series of posterboards emblazoned with X-rated images from the younger Biden’s infamous laptop, the MAGA congresswoman asked the two witnesses if they believed the president’s son’s involvement with prostitutes violated any federal laws.\n",
      "“So when Hunter Biden paid for this woman to do this with him, to travel across state lines from California to Washington, D.C., on June 15, this is a violation of the Mann Act. This was prostitution,” she said, holding up censored photos of a nude Hunter Biden.\n",
      "Joseph Ziegler, an IRS Special Agent with the Criminal Investigation Division, eventually told the Georgia lawmaker that he would need to refer her questions about Hunter Biden allegedly writing off payments to prostitutes to the House Ways and Means Committee. However, she persisted.\n",
      "Even after Ranking Member Jamie Raskin (D-MD) pointed out that Greene was nearly two minutes over her time, the congresswoman kept asking Ziegler about a potential IRS investigation into “Hunter Biden making sex tapes” and “online pornography.” She then waved around yet another large nude photo of the presidential scion, prompting gasps from the crowd and an objection from Raskin.\n",
      "“Should we be displaying this, Mr. Chairman?!” Raskin exclaimed while another Democrat said this was “unbecoming” of the chamber.\n",
      "Asking for a point of order, Rep. Dan Goldman (D-NY) complained about Greene publicizing images that “are not actually even allegations much less evidence of anything.” Conceding that it was a “good point,” Comer went on to say that the material had been “on the internet long before I became chairman of this committee” and therefore was already publicized.\n",
      "Following Greene’s antics, some Democrats took her to task.\n",
      "“Today’s hearing is like most of the majority’s investigations and hearings: A lot of allegations, zero proof, no receipts—but apparently, some dick pics,” Rep. Robert Garcia (D-CA) said later in the hearing.\n",
      "Lacking a certain amount of decorum in his response, however, Rep. Jared Moskowitz (D-FL) tweeted that the photos revealed that “perhaps we should call Hunter Biden the ‘Big Guy,’” referencing an alleged nickname for the president in Hunter’s emails.\n",
      "Speaker of the House Kevin McCarthy’s office did not immediately respond to a request for comment about whether Greene’s behavior was appropriate and if he planned any disciplinary action against her.\n",

      "On Thursday, that House Ways and Means Committee on Thursday released testimony from two IRS whistleblowers who said the Department of Justice, FBI and IRS had interfered with the investigation of the tax evasion case against Hunter Biden.\n",
      "Gary Shapley, Jr., an IRS Criminal Supervisory Special Agent who oversaw the IRS probe into the president's son, testified that in 2018, Hunter Biden listed payments to prostitutes on his tax returns to the company Owasco P.C., which allegedly \"brought in his consulting fees.\"\n",
      "\"There were multiple examples of prostitutes that were ordered basically, and we have all the communications between that where he would pay for these prostitutes, would book them a flight where even the flight ticket showed their name. And then he expensed those,\" Shapley testified.\n",
      "Shapley said some flights were first class tickets, while others were on Frontier Airlines.\n",
      "Shapley said that in Biden's 2018 tax return, which was filed late and not prepared until 2020, he was \"expensing personal expenses, his business expenses.\"\n",
      "\"So, I mean, everything, there was a payment that — there was a $25,000 to one of his girlfriends and it said, \"golf membership.\" And then we went out and followed that money it was for a sex club membership in LA.\"\n",
      "The Hunter Biden tax investigation — codenamed \"Sportsman\" — was opened in November 2018 as an \"offshoot\" of an IRS investigation into a \"foreign-based amateur online pornography platform,\" Shapley told Congress.\n",
      "The probe into Hunter Biden's finances began in 2018 amid the discovery of suspicious activity reports regarding funds\n",
      "The investigation had previously been believed to have been predicated, in part, by suspicious transactions from \"China and other foreign nations.\"\n",
      "\"So the worst part about 2018 is that Hunter Biden's accountants are sitting there with him at a table, and they have all the numbers in front of them, right? The bank accounts in front of them and they are saying that, you know, you need to circle what are business expenses so that we know what to deduct,\" Shapley testified.\n",
      "\"So it becomes apparent to the accountants during this interaction that he's putting things on here that aren't expenses, that aren't true business expenses,\" He said.\n",
      "\"So the accountants create a representation letter that basically they said they have never done before. And they had him sign this document, and it was basically because they didn't believe what he was saying, but they didn't — if they were going to prepare his return, they had to listen to what he was saying. I mean, I guess they could have just chosen not to prepare his tax return, would have been their only out. But that was the type of conduct in 2018,\" he continued.\n",
      "Shapley testified that decisions in the case seemed to be \"influenced by politics\" and that \"at every stage\" of the probe were made that \"had the effect of benefiting the subject of the investigation.\"\n",
      "The revelations come on the heels of the Justice Department's announcement Tuesday that Hunter Biden will plead guilty to two misdemeanor counts of willful failure to pay federal income tax.\n",

      "North Korea in recent years has been testing newly developed cruise missiles it describes as \"strategic,\" implying an intent to arm them with nuclear weapons. Experts say the main mission of those weapons would include striking naval assets and ports. Designed to fly like small airplanes and travel along landscape that would make them harder to detect by radar, cruise missiles are among a growing collection of North Korean weapons aimed at overwhelming missile defenses in the South.\n",
      "On Wednesday, North Korea fired two short-range ballistic missiles from an area near its capital, Pyongyang. They flew about 550 kilometers (340 miles) before landing in waters east of the Korean Peninsula.\n",
      "The flight distance of those missiles roughly matched the distance between Pyongyang and the South Korean port city of Busan, where the USS Kentucky on Tuesday made the first visit by a U.S. nuclear-armed submarine to South Korea since the 1980s.\n",

It could be weeks, or even months, before North Korea releases meaningful information about King, analysts say, as the country could drag out his detention to maximize leverage and add urgency to U.S. efforts to secure his release.\n",
      "Some experts say the North may try to use King for propaganda or as a bargaining chip to coax political and security concessions from Washington, possibly tying his release with the United States cutting back its military activities with South Korea.\n",
      "\"With so many moving pieces, it's important not to attribute causation to mere correlation of events. But North Korea's missile provocations do not foreshadow an easy negotiation to secure Travis King's release,\" said Leif-Eric Easley, a professor at South Korea's Ewha University. \"Unauthorized border crossings endanger personnel, risk a political and even military incident, and can be exploited by North Korean hostage diplomacy.\"\n",
      "The United States and South Korea have been expanding their combined military exercises and have agreed to increase the regional deployment of U.S. strategic assets like bombers, aircraft carriers and submarines in a show of force against North Korea, which has test-fired around 100 missiles since the start of 2022.\n",
      "The allies also kicked off new rounds of nuclear contingency planning meetings that are partially aimed at easing fears among the South Korean public about the North's growing nuclear threat and suppressing voices within the country that it should pursue its own deterrent.\n",
      "North Korea's defense minister issued a veiled threat Thursday suggesting the docking of the Kentucky in South Korea could be grounds for a nuclear attack by the North. North Korea has used such rhetoric before, but the comments underscored how much relations are strained now.\n",
      "South Korea's Defense Ministry on Friday described the deployment of the Kentucky and the nuclear contingency planning meetings between Washington and Seoul as \"defensive response measures\" to counter the North Korean threat. The ministry said in a statement it \"strongly warns\" that any nuclear attack by the North on the allies would face an \"immediate, overwhelming and decisive response ... that would bring an end to the North Korean regime.\"\n",

      "Original Article : England fails to impress in first look at Women's World Cup\n",
      "It was one of the most pressing questions coming into this Women's World Cup.\n",
      "Could England, despite missing four of the 11 starters from last summer's European Championship triumph – the only trophy, men's or women's, the country that invented the sport has won in more than half a century – overcome those absences and compete for soccer's ultimate prize?\n",
      "If Saturday's 1-0 win over Haiti is anything to go by, the answer is probably not.\n",
      "In a wildly entertaining match in Brisbane, Australia, the Lionesses rode a first-half penalty kick by Georgia Stanway to claim all three points against a tournament newcomer playing in its very first World Cup game. The win was fully expected. The manner of victory, well, that part was anything but impressive.\n",
      "Even without the injured trio of Fran Kirby, Beth Mead, Leah Williamson and the retired Ellen White, FIFA's fourth-ranked squad was supposed to pummel the No. 53 Haitians. The bigger tests for England were supposed to come later in the first round, in matches against Denmark and China, and then in the knockout phase. The group stage was supposed to be nothing more than a formality.\n",
      "But after watching the Lionesses struggle for long stretches against a plucky, athletic but decidedly inexperienced foe, it's all but impossible to see England standing on the podium with confetti raining down around them following the Aug. 20 final in Sydney.\n",
      "England came into the competition with the bookies' second-best odds of winning it all, behind the two-time defending United States. But while the title-favorite U.S. was held to a single goal by debutant Vietnam until deep into first half stoppage time in their opening match on Friday, they still ran out as 3-0 winners by the time the final whistle blew.\n",
      "Saturday marked just the third day of the 2023 World Cup, and already a trend has started to emerge. Billed as the most competitive tourney ever, that's precisely how it has played out so far.\n",
      "So while it's possible that England will rebound from its lackluster opener and go on to make a deep run, it sure doesn't seem likely following its opening contest. That's not to take anything away from the Haitians, who deserve a ton of credit for their performance.\n",
      "Les Grenadières defended their hearts out on Saturday and scared their more decorated opponent on more than one occasion. Haiti fought for every 50-50 ball. The players most certainly didn't play scared. And they might even have stolen a goal with just a little more patience and quality in England's end. Even then, Haiti came oh-so-close to netting the equalizer several times after falling behind, their three shots on target forcing a trio of superb saves out of goalkeeper Mary Earps in the second half. Melchie Daëlle Dumornay, just 19, was a revelation for the Haitians throughout.\n",
      "While England still collected all three points, they really didn't look dangerous despite a 21-7 shot and 75-25 possession advantage, despite Haitian backstop Kerly Théus making nine saves – some of them spectacular – of her own.\n",
      "The hard truth for England supporters is that Wiegman's side had next to no answers without veteran attackers Kirby, Mead and White in its first game, the Lionesses' only goal coming on a retaken effort from the spot after a silly (and totally avoidable) handball by winger Batcheba Louis.\n",
      "In other words, England got lucky. And it's going to get much harder from here.\n",
      "\"What we want to do, of course, is finish our chances,\" Wiegman said afterward. \"I hope the next game in open play we can score a goal.\"\n",
      "The Lionesses are capable of that. Winning the World Cup without some of their most experienced and important players? They can still hope for that, too. But based on Saturday's evidence at least, that particular goal is almost certainly beyond them.\n",

      "AUCKLAND, New Zealand -- The U.S. women's national team got off to winning start, even as it wasted a tournament's worth of chances in a 3-0 win over Vietnam. Sophia Smith -- one of six World Cup debutantes for the U.S. -- was the star of the game with two goals and an assist. But the U.S. was made to work hard for its win, as Vietnam proved to be organized and disciplined in frustrating the Americans for long stretches. Alex Morgan having a penalty saved by Vietnam keeper Tran Thi Kim Thanh added to the frustration.\n",
      "But ultimately the U.S. did more than enough to the win -- it held a 28-0 shot advantage, though only seven were on target, and even got a look at Julie Ertz as a center-back. Ertz had previously been thought to be the team's starting midfielder, but the recent injury to Becky Sauerbrunn changed the plans of manager Vlatko Andonovski, and Ertz looked solid alongside Naomi Girma.\n",
      "Both Rose Lavelle and Megan Rapinoe made appearances late in the match, with Rapinoe's giving her 200 appearances with the U.S. women's national team. All in all, a good night. -- Jeff Carlisle\n",
      "Sophia Smith discusses her 2-goal performance in the United States' 3-0 win over Vietnam.\n",
      "BRISBANE, Australia -- England are off and running, but it was far from convincing as they survived a scare to beat World Cup debutants Haiti 1-0 in Brisbane. Goalkeeper Mary Earps was England's best player, while Haiti will have felt aggrieved to not come away from this match with at least a point as their marauding midfielder Melchie Dumornay was the best outfield player on the pitch.\n",
      "Before the game, Haiti manager Nicolas Delépine pointed out England's recent wastefulness in front of goal and there was little evidence to suggest they've solved that problem. For so much of the match England were living off scraps up front, with Georgia Stanway's 29th minute penalty the only thing separating the teams (which she scored at the second time of asking, after her first effort was saved and then ruled out as goalkeeper Kerly Théus had come too far off her line.)\n",
      "Sam Marsden and Marissa Lordanic give their verdict on England's performance after their 1-0 win vs. Haiti.\n",
      "The introduction of Lauren James on the hour mark didn't bring the required fluidity in attack to England's game as Ella Toone struggled to get into the game in the No. 10 role, while Alessia Russo had a series of half-decent chances but saw them well saved by Theus. Instead, it was Haiti who had the best chances to score. Roselord Borgella missed a one-on-one in the first half, Haiti had two decent chances when players were left unmarked in the box from corners, while Lyon-bound Dumornay forced Earps into a smart save in the second half.\n",
      "It was only further heroics from Earps in the 80th minute which kept Haiti out as she was forced into a fine stop with her feet against Roseline Eloissaint, who had escaped England's defence to carve out a huge chance. A 1-0 win is job done for England, but it was far from convincing. -- Tom Hamilton\n",
      "Japan off to a fine start\n",
      "HAMILTON, New Zealand -- Since they won the 2011 World Cup and then a silver medal at the 2012 Olympics, the last decade for Japan's women has been a casual slide into frustration, backed by a sense of apathy from the JFA. Even when they reached the World Cup final in 2015, Japan did so without really flexing their muscles, moving the ball but rarely pressing the issue.\n",
      "With almost all of the 2011 side now phased out or retired, the team have struggled to reach their enigmatic best. Yet, following the appointment of Futoshi Ikeda -- the former U20 and U17 coach -- the team have finally started to find form, even though it took over a year to start seeing positive performances.\n",
      "Needing a strong start against Zambia, Nadeshiko fell foul of VAR and the offside flag on multiple occasions as they took their time to settle into the game, finding calm and joy in their attacking football. The deadlock was broken with a 43rd-minute goal from Hinata Miyazawa, then the floodgates opened once Mina Tanaka finally found the net in the second half (after having two earlier efforts called back for offside by VAR) and Miyazawa scored again. Jun Endo and substitute Riko Ueki added some gloss to the scoreline and Zambia goalkeeper Catherine Musonda was dismissed late on for two yellow cards.\n",
      "More than just keeping the ball and going forward well, Japan managed to stop the supply lines to the Copper Queens' talismanic Barbra Banda, taking the captain out of the game and muting the entire opposition in the process. With a potentially long journey ahead of them, their commanding 5-0 win should provide firm foundations for the team to build on as they work their way through the tournament. For now the win takes them top of the table, ahead of Spain on goal difference. -- Sophie Lawson\n",
      "Penalties, VAR an early theme of this World Cup\n",
      "The penalties keep on coming in Australia and New Zealand. By the end of England's narrow win over Haiti on Saturday, all eight games played had seen one awarded. Only half of them have been scored, though, with some big players missing from 12 yards.\n",
      "New Zealand's Ria Percival, Canada's Christine Sinclair, Spain's Jenni Hermoso and USA's Alex Morgan have all squandered spot kicks, although only Sinclair's miss proved crucial as Canada dropped two points against Nigeria. England's Georgia Stanway and Japan's Riko Ueki also saw penalties saved, although they were handed a second chance by VAR because the goalkeepers had encroached. Both then converted their second efforts.\n",
      "It is the use of VAR that has led to the spike in penalties. Five of the eight given in the tournament were not spotted in real time; instead, the referees awarded them after reviewing the pitchside monitor, announcing the decision over the microphone as FIFA trials a new method of keeping fans informed. Perhaps the most controversial call came in Switzerland's win over the Philippines when Jessika Cowart was deemed to have fouled Coumba Sow, although play had continued without any protest from the Swiss.\n",
      "At the current rate of one per game, the record for penalties at a Women's World Cup will be smashed. Four years ago, 26 were given in 52 games, setting the current high at an average of 0.5 penalties per game. In 2015, 22 were awarded (0.42 per game), but prior to that the average had never gone beyond 0.35 and the count never higher than 11, although the number of games played in the World Cup has continued to increase. -- Sam Marsden\n",
      "Denmark 1-0 China\n",
      "Given that the 2023 FIFA Women's World Cup marked the end of a 16-year gap between tournament appearances for Denmark, some sense of nervousness and disjointedness was to be expected in their opening game. Few Danish fans, though, will be happy that it took almost 90 minutes for coach Lars Sondergaard's side to find the back of the net in future contests.\n",
      "De rod-hvide finally broke through a spirited Chinese defence to secure a 1-0 winning start to their World Cup in Saturday's late kickoff, when Pernille Harder swung in a corner in the dying stages that substitute Amalie Vangsgaard drove home with a powerful header.

      "Franco, an outspoken defender of marginalised populations, was killed with her driver Anderson Gomes in a drive-by shooting in March 2018. Two former police officers accused of carrying out the murders were arrested a year later – but they are yet to stand trial by jury and an investigation into who ordered the assassination has dragged on slowly ever since.\n",
      "The former firefighter Maxwell Simões Corrêa, known as “Suel”, was arrested at his home in western Rio on Monday.\n",
      "Federal police also executed seven search and seizure warrants at addresses around Rio as part of the operation, named “Elpis” after the spirit of hope in Greek mythology.\n",
      "Simões Corrêa was already under house arrest for obstruction of justice, but new evidence pointing to his deeper involvement in the murders led officers to detain him, the federal police chief, Andrei Rodrigues told reporters.\n",
      "According to investigators, Simões Corrêa gave logistical support to Ronnie Lessa and Élcio Vieira de Queiroz, the ex-police officers accused of firing the shots and driving the car used for the killings.\n",
      "The new suspect is alleged to have helped plan Franco’s murder, as well as provided and disposed of the vehicle used for the crime. He has also given financial support to Queiroz’s family since the ex-police officer was put behind bars, the prosecutor Eduardo Morais Martins said in a press conference in Rio.\n",
      "Monday’s operation was carried out by the federal police, who in February launched their own investigation into Franco’s murder and its motives, to assist a parallel state-led inquiry riddled with criticisms of inefficiency.\n",
      "This produced new evidence and a plea deal with Queiroz, the justice minister, Flávio Dino, said at the Brasília press conference. Queiroz not only confessed to his role as the driver in the murders, but also implicated Lessa as the man who pulled the trigger and gave new details leading to Simões Corrêa’s arrest.\n",
      "Remaining questions around the crime’s execution have been cleared up and “an important phase of the investigation has been closed”, said Dino, adding that the focus would now shift to finding out who ordered the murders. The minister confirmed speculation that paramilitary gangs known as militias – mafias that control large swathes of Rio state and are often made up of current or former state police officers – are implicated in the crime.\n",
      "“I want to assure the victims’ families and civil society that the investigation is moving forward and will produce new results,” Dino said, adding that the latest developments are a sign of “a state commitment to solving all crimes and fighting impunity”.\n",
      "Dino had pledged to solve Franco’s murder as “a matter of state honour” when the Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva government took office in January, in sharp contrast with the previous Jair Bolsonaro administration, which came under fierce criticism for its lack of commitment to resolving the case.\n",
      "Franco’s sister Anielle, the current minister for racial equality, welcomed the news of the arrest. “I reaffirm my trust in the federal police running the investigation and repeat the question I have been asking for the last five years: who ordered Marielle’s killing and why?” Anielle Franco wrote on Twitter.\n",

      "For many years Strelkov, 53, had been considered untouchable, says BBC Russian's Ilya Barabanov.\n",

      "Original Article : On Thursday morning, Politico reported that Kevin McCarthy had promised Donald Trump that he’d hold a House vote to “expunge the two impeachments against the former president” before the August recess, in an attempt to get back on Trump’s good side after suggesting the ex-president might not be the best candidate for the 2024 GOP nomination. Hours later, McCarthy denied this.\n",
      "At this time you might be wondering, as part of that denial, did McCarthy forcefully insist that expunging Trump’s pair of impeachments—the first for trying to extort Ukraine into digging up dirt on his political rival, the second for inciting an insurrection—would be some thoroughly repugnant Orwellian shit? Did he point out that it would be an insult to the brave law enforcement officers who protected his congressional colleagues on that dark day in January? Did he unequivocally deny he would ever be part of a movement to do the very thing Politico reported he’d promised to do? Uh, not exactly!\n",
      "Instead, he merely denied that an official deal to expunge Trump’s impeachments had been struck while nevertheless noting that he would absolutely love to see it happen.\n",
      "“There’s no deal, but I’ve been very clear from long before—when I voted against impeachments—that they put them in for purely political purposes,” McCarthy told reporters. “I support expungement, but there’s no deal out there.”\n",
      "Of course, McCarthy’s claiming that there isn’t an actual deal does not mean that’s true. The reason we know that is because he’s been caught lying in the past, like when he forcefully denied a New York Times report saying he had told colleagues that Trump was at fault for “inciting people” to attack the Capitol building and that he was going to advise Trump to resign…only to be caught on tape saying the things the Times had reported.\n",
      "Furthermore, there’s obviously no reason whatsoever to give McCarthy—who, again, publicly stated that he does, in fact, want Trump’s impeachments expunged!—the benefit of the doubt here, given that he voted to overturn the 2020 election in January 2021; refused to meaningfully hold Trump accountable for the insurrection during the impeachment proceedings; lied about the riot to get on Trump’s good side; and claimed this week that Trump is only facing an indictment for his attempt to overturn the election because he’s so very popular.\n",

      "Ron DeSantis’s Florida will teach kids that there were upsides to being a slave, and no, that’s not a joke\n",
      "When the Florida State Board of Education announced earlier this year that it would ban the College Board’s AP American Studies course from its public schools, claiming it lacked “educational value,” the collective response from non-bigots was basically, “Wow, you can’t get much more f--ked up and racist than that.” To which Florida decided to respond, “Oh no, we can!”\n",
      "Per The Washington Post:\n",
      "If you can’t quite believe what you’re reading, we’ll repeat it again for emphasis: Florida schools are now required to teach students that there was a bright side to being forced into slavery. And if that wasn’t bad enough, the new rules also dictate that, per when teaching about mob violence against Black people—like, y’know, lynchings—teachers should also note “acts of violence perpetrated against and by African Americans.”\n",
      "Last year, The New York Times reported that as a teacher at a private school in Georgia, DeSantis stuck out to students thanks to his views on the Civil War and slavery:\n",
      "Meanwhile, DeSantis’s point of view on slavery was apparently so well known that ”students made a satirical video about him” in which a student meant to be DeSantis is heard saying, according to the Times, “The Civil War was not about slavery! It was about two competing economic systems. One was in the North….”\n",
      "On Wednesday, Florida Education commissioner Manny Diaz insisted that the new rules make the state’s Black history curriculum more “robust,” saying, “I think this is something that is going to set the norm for standards in other states.” State representative Anna Eskamani, stating what should be but apparently is not obvious, told the Times the notion of teaching students that enslaved people learned important life skills “is inaccurate and a scary standard for us to establish.”\n",

      "Original Article : The country’s annual defense spending measure was narrowly approved by the Republican-led House of Representatives on Friday, and although the bill is several steps from becoming law, the White House has announced its opposition to a range of national security provisions, including inaction on the special immigrant visas (SIV) for Afghans.\n",
      "The House version of the National Defense Authorization Act does not increase the SIV cap by 20,000 in fiscal 2024 or extend the SIV program beyond December 31, 2024, despite the administration’s request to do so.\n",
      "In 2009, the Afghan Allies Protection Act was approved by Congress, leading to the implementation of the Afghan SIV program — an immigrant visa program that helps military interpreters and others who worked for the U.S. government to come to the U.S. with a direct pathway to permanent residency.\n",
      "Through this program, the U.S. government has successfully resettled more than 100,000 Afghans and their families in the United States. However, if the annual defense policy bill does not include an extension of the program, it would end a legal immigration path to the United States for Afghans who worked for the U.S. government during the war in Afghanistan at the end of 2024.\n",
      "“Giving our Afghan allies a chance to apply for legal status is the right and necessary thing to do,” U.S. Senator Amy Klobuchar, a Democrat from Minnesota, said in a statement.\n",
      "Another strategy\n",
      "On the same day the House passed its version of the NDAA, a bipartisan group of lawmakers reintroduced the Afghan Adjustment Act (AAA) in the House and the Senate.\n",
      "It would also expand SIV eligibility to include more Afghans. Women, who served in special counterterrorism teams, and others who worked with U.S. forces as commandos and air force personnel, could be eligible for the SIV program. It would also establish a path to U.S. citizenship for Afghans with humanitarian parole status living in the United States. SIV presently covers translators, interpreters, or other professionals employed by or on behalf of the U.S. government in Afghanistan.\n",
      "Dara Lind, a senior fellow with the American Immigration Council, wrote Tuesday that the NDAA has become a vehicle “for many other legislative proposals to pass into law.”\n",
      "“Because the need for the AAA is a direct consequence of the U.S. occupation of (and withdrawal from) Afghanistan, and the Department of Defense has long supported ways for Afghans who assisted the government to become U.S. citizens, including the AAA in the current defense authorization bill is thematically appropriate, to say the least. It’s also, given Congress’ aversion to voting on standalone immigration bills, the most likely way the AAA will pass,” Lind wrote.\n",
      "In 2022, the AAA also was supported by a group of lawmakers from both parties and expected to be included in the omnibus spending package. But it failed to win congressional approval.\n",
      "Senator Chuck Grassley, then-ranking Republican on the Senate Judiciary Committee, and others objected to the legislation on security grounds, VOA reported.\n",
      "Following the U.S. military withdrawal from Afghanistan in August 2021, more than 70,000 Afghans were brought to the United States and granted a temporary humanitarian parole status that lasts for two years.\n",
      "Humanitarian parole is given to those hoping to enter the U.S. under emergency circumstances. While it does not automatically lead to permanent residency, parolees can apply for legal status through the asylum process or other forms of sponsorship, if available, once they're in the U.S.\n",
      "But the humanitarian status is only temporary.\n",
      "U.S. Senator Jerry Moran, a Republican from Kansas, said Afghans who escaped to the U.S., face uncertainty because their original parole statuses are temporary.\n",
      "“[The AAA] legislation establishes a pathway for our Afghan partners to begin a new life while also establishing a critical vetting process to reduce threats to our national security,” Moran wrote in a statement.\n",
      "In January, VOA reported that more than 40,000 Afghans living outside the U.S. had submitted humanitarian parole applications since the U.S. withdrawal from Afghanistan. Others were allowed to continue their SIV process inside the United States, which leads to a direct pathway to permanent residency.\n",
      "“Two decades of allyship merits much more than an unnecessary and unsustainable legal limbo. The Afghan Adjustment Act is precisely how we provide the stability our new Afghan neighbors deserve while demonstrating that the United States honors its promises of protection to its allies,” Krish O’Mara Vignarajah, president and CEO of Lutheran Immigration and Refugee Service, told reporters.\n",
      "The Senate has drafted and needs to pass its own version of the NDAA. Once both bills are approved, they will need to be reconciled, and a compromised version will have to be approved once again by the Senate and House.\n",

      "It’s “like moving from an oven to a refrigerator,” Peters told The Times.\n",

      "“The priest fainted at the end of the wedding ceremony and a family member had to deliver the blessings,” Peters told the outlet.\n",

      "A recently published article introduces a conceptual framework for analyzing passported benefits, shedding light on the challenges that individuals face when accessing these additional cash or in-kind benefits. The article, based on a case study from Israel, identifies five key dimensions of passported benefits and explores the administrative burden associated with each dimension.\n",
      "The research highlights the pressing need for simplification, automation, and improved coordination to reduce the administrative burden and ensure that passported benefits serve as a streamlined pathway to social rights. The study titled, \"Understanding Administrative Burden and Complexity in Passported Benefits: A Case Study from Israel,\" is published in the Journal of Social Policy.\n",
      "Passported benefits are supplementary benefits provided to individuals who already receive direct cash benefits, aiming to provide extra support without bureaucratic processes. However, the article highlights that accessing these benefits can be challenging, leading to low take-up. To better understand these challenges, the study employs the concept of administrative burden, referring to the burdensome experiences individuals encounter when navigating bureaucratic processes.\n",
      "The research finds that passported benefits in Israel are complex and decentralized, with diverse eligibility tracks and implementation. The study identifies five dimensions that shape passported benefits: the role of primary cash benefits in determining eligibility, level of automation, legal status, type of service delivery, and degree of decentralization. Each dimension contributes to the administrative burden experienced by individuals.\n",
      "Eligibility for passported benefits in Israel goes beyond a simple connection to primary benefits, introducing additional conditions and distinctions. Automation plays a crucial role in determining eligibility, with some benefits being automated while others require active application from claimants.\n",
      "The legal status of these benefits varies and affects their stability and potential for policy changes. Service delivery methods range from in-kind services to cash assistance and tax breaks. The decentralization of passported benefits involves multiple entities, adding complexity to the claiming process.\n",
      "The study emphasizes that the complexity and administrative burden associated with passported benefits can lead to low take-up rates of the benefits. It highlights the need for simplification, automation, and flexibility in the processes to reduce burden and improve access. Unifying take-up processes and developing assessment tools are also recommended to manage the administrative burden effectively.\n",
      "The research draws attention to the importance of academic scrutiny and theoretical understanding of passported benefits, which have historically received less attention compared to primary benefits in the welfare state. The study calls for further research to better understand and address the intensity of administrative burden in passported benefits.\n",

      "“Bruno was known for his big voice and his exuberant personality and as ‘head chef’, he proudly flipped the burgers at the parish picnic,\" wrote Paul and Ginny Arpino, who were related to the victims, in the letter to the church community.\n",
      "They said Jill D'Amore had taken on the ministry of beautifying the church’s environment.\n",
      "“Without a single day of liturgical training she simply followed her heart, caring for the flowers and decorating for the liturgical seasons,” they wrote.\n",
      "Until coronavirus pandemic, Lucia Arpino never missed morning Mass, they said.\n",
      "“Lucia will be especially missed on the upcoming Our Lady of Mt. Carmel Festa weekend as she faithfully walked in that procession through the streets of Nonantum well into her 90’s,” they wrote.\n",
      "The preliminary investigation indicated the victims died of stab wounds and blunt force trauma, Ryan said. Investigators found signs of forced entry into the basement, and Ryan described a chaotic scene in which there were “obvious signs of struggle.” A crystal paperweight was covered in blood, and furniture was broken.\n",
      "Ferguson is charged with killing Jill D’Amore after an autopsy revealed her death was a homicide. Ferguson also was charged with two counts of assault and battery with a dangerous weapon causing serious bodily injury, and burglary.\n",
      "Additional charges are expected in the death Bruno D’Amore and Arpino after those autopsies are completed.\n",
      "There was an attempted break-in about a half-mile (800 meters) from the victims’ home early Sunday, but it’s unclear if the two crimes were related, Ryan said.\n",

      "Original Article : BRISBANE, Australia -- Indigenous sports leaders and advocates have urged FIFA to address what they've called an “egregious omission” of First Nations organizations in Australia in a Women’s World Cup legacy plan.\n",
      "Former Sydney Swans Australian rules football star Adam Goodes and John Moriarty, the first Indigenous player to make Australia’s national soccer team, are among the signatories to a letter sent to soccer’s world governing body regarding funding in the wake of the World Cup.\n",
      "Football Australia’s Legacy ’23 plan, formed in 2021, is a strategy designed to deliver economic, social and health benefits and multicultural inclusion following its co-hosting of the global tournament.\n",
      "The joint letter to FIFA said while the report released this month features a statement acknowledging First Nations contributors to the success of women's soccer in Australia, it doesn’t include specific funding for Indigenous programs.\n",
      "The letter was also signed by Sydney FC goalkeeper Jada Whyman, an Indigenous player who was called into Matildas camp in April for games against England and Scotland, co-chief executive of Professional Footballers Australia, Kate Gill, A-League women’s players Gema Simon and Allira Toby and former Socceroo Travis Dodd.\n",
      "“Despite ubiquitous Indigenous culture, symbolism, traditional ceremonies and installations at the World Cup and the holding out of Indigenous culture as something of central value to football, not a single dollar from the legacy program has been committed to organizations that are Indigenous-led,” the letter said.\n",
      "“Without support for the Indigenous community and their programs, we consider this symbolism empty.”\n",
      "The letter was also sent to Football Australia.\n",
      "Before the Women’s World Cup began, FIFA secretary general Fatma Samoura said the tournament provided a platform to give opportunities to all people. She said officials needed to highlight issues for First Nations people in Australia and New Zealand.\n",
      "“Because you cannot play the simple game of football by leaving outside the people without whom this nation would not have existed,” Samoura said during a visit with Indigenous players. “We cannot come and just play and leave.”\n",
      "Indigenous track legend Cathy Freeman, who won the 400-meter gold medal at the 2000 Sydney Olympics in one of Australia's most iconic sporting moments, visited the Australian women's team before the tournament began. The Matildas have two Indigenous players in their current lineup, goalkeeper Lydia Williams and striker Kyah Simon.\n",
      "Separately, the Indigenous Football Australia Council, formed to assist the John Moriarty Football program, is also calling on FIFA and Football Australia to include funding for First Nations-led programs in the Legacy ’23 plan before the end of the Women's World Cup.\n",
      "The John Moriarty Foundation has also launched a crowd-funding campaign “ Call Time on Inequality ” to address the lack of elite level Indigenous players and raise funds to tackle the disparity they face.\n",
      "“Now is the time to level the playing field by reaching even more children, more communities and empowering the next generation of Indigenous football players,” Moriarty said. “There needs to be increased investment in solutions that will lead to impactful social change and ensure equal access to football for both grassroots and elite Indigenous players.”\n",

      "Across vast swathes of the planet, from California to China, authorities have warned of the health dangers of the extreme heat, urging people to drink water and shelter from the burning sun.\n",
      "In a stark reminder of the effects of global warming, the UN’s World Meteorological Agency (WMO) said the trend of heatwaves “shows no signs of decreasing”.\n",
      "“These events will continue to grow in intensity, and the world needs to prepare for more intense heatwaves,” John Nairn, a senior extreme heat adviser at the WMO told reporters in Geneva.\n",
      "“Repeated high night-time temperatures are particularly dangerous for human health, because the body is unable to recover from sustained heat,” he said. “This leads to increased cases of heart attacks and death.”\n",
      "World Meteorological Agency warns of risk of heart attacks, deaths during extreme heat\n",
      "Temperatures were unforgiving in Italy and in Spain, where three regions were put under hot weather red alerts. But as of midday, the Italian islands of Sardinia and Sicily had yet to surpass a continent-wide record of 48.8 degrees Celsius, (119.8 degrees Fahrenheit), recorded in Sicily in August 2021.\n",
      "Many throughout Italy sought escape by the sea, including outside Rome, where the midday heat hit 40 degrees. Back in Rome, street hawkers substituted parasols and fans for selfie sticks, as tourists struggled to find rare patches of shade and waiters sported short sleeves instead of their customary more formal attire.\n",
      "Tourists still needed to eat, said Mauro Natale, 45, a waiter at a cafe near the Pantheon, but “instead of a carbonara or an amatriciana (pasta), they just want to eat salad”.\n",
      "Northwest of the Greek capital Athens, a vast cloud of smoke loomed over the forest of Dervenohoria, where one of several fires around the capital and beyond was still burning.\n",
      "The heatwaves across Europe and the globe are “not one single phenomenon but several acting at the same time,” said Robert Vautard, director of France’s Pierre-Simon Laplace climate institute. “But they are all strengthened by one factor: climate change.”\n",
      "In drought-stricken Spain, temperatures were set to reach highs of 44C in Catalonia and the Balearic Islands. “You can’t be in the street, it’s horrible, horrible, horrible, horrible, horrible,” said Lidia Rodriguez, 27, in Madrid.\n",
      "In the Canary Islands, some 400 firefighters battled a wildfire that has ravaged 3,500 hectares of forest and forced 4,000 residents to evacuate, with authorities warning residents to wear face masks outside due to poor air quality.\n",
