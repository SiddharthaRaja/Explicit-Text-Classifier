Machine Learning and Natural Language Processing

• Developed an explicit content classifier using Python, NLP, and machine learning techniques.
• Achieved a positive precision score of 0.86 and a positive recall score of 0.96.
• Applied TF-IDF vectorization (unigram and bigram features) to convert text into numerical features.
• Created real-time prediction functions to classify new text inputs as explicit or non-explicit.
